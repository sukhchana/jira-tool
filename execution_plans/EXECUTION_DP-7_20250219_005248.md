        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

- {'id': 'USER-STORY-3', 'title': 'User Story - Validate and Authorize API Requests', 'description': 'As an Application, I want to validate incoming access tokens and enforce authorization rules, so that only authorized users and applications can access protected resources', 'technical_domain': 'Authentication and Authorization', 'story_points': 3, 'implementation_notes': {'technical_considerations': '', 'integration_points': '', 'accessibility': ''}}

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions using OAuth 2, leveraging the existing Enterprise Active Directory and PING Federate as the OAuth 2 server.
Technical Domains:
- Authentication and Authorization:**
- Best Practices:** Implement secure OAuth 2 flows, validate tokens, and enforce authorization based on user roles.
- Technologies:** Python libraries like Flask-OAuthlib, oauthlib, requests-oauthlib.
- Identity Management:**
- Best Practices:** Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) for user authentication and attribute retrieval from Active Directory.
- Technologies:**  OpenID Connect libraries for Python (e.g., pyoidc).
- API Security:**
- Best Practices:** Secure communication with PING Federate using HTTPS, implement proper error handling, and protect sensitive information.
- Technologies:** TLS/SSL encryption, Python libraries for secure communication.
Core Requirements:
- OAuth 2 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) in the Python application.
- Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the Enterprise Active Directory, sourcing user details and roles.
- PING Federate Integration:**  Configure PING Federate as the OAuth 2 Authorization Server and establish communication for token issuance and validation.
Stakeholders:
- Application Users:** Both human and machine users requiring access to the application.
- System Administrators:** Responsible for managing user access and system security.
