  "changes_requested": "Ensure LEAST Privilege is respected.",
  "changes_interpreted": "<interpretation>\nThe user request highlights a crucial security principle, the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP), which dictates that users should only have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. \n\n**Requested Changes:**\n\n1. **Scope Down Access**:  The current ticket broadly grants access to \"protected resources.\" The revision requires specifying *which* resources are accessible with this endpoint and to *which* user roles or permissions. \n2. **Enforce Fine-Grained Permissions**: Implement mechanisms to enforce these specific permissions within the API endpoint's logic.\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\n\n- **Fields to Modify**:\n    - `description`:  Clarify which protected resources the endpoint provides access to.\n    - `acceptance_criteria`: Add criteria related to verifying Least Privilege enforcement.\n    - `implementation_details`: Update the token validation logic to include permission checks.\n    - `security_considerations`:  Expand on how the implementation ensures Least Privilege.\n- **Dependencies Affected**: Potentially Yes. If other tickets rely on this broad access model, they might need adjustments to align with the more restrictive approach.\n- **Related Tickets Impact**:  Identify and review any tickets related to:\n    - Resource management or access control.\n    - User roles and permissions.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1. **Define Resource Access**:\n    - Identify the specific resources this endpoint should protect.\n    - Determine which user roles or permissions should have access to each resource.\n2. **Update Ticket Details**:\n    - Modify the ticket description to clearly state the resources and access levels.\n    - Add acceptance criteria to ensure Least Privilege is tested (e.g., \"Users with insufficient permissions are denied access\").\n3. **Implement Permission Checks**:\n    - Within the token validation logic (`implementation_details`), extract user roles or permissions from the validated token.\n    - Add conditional logic to grant or deny access to resources based on the user's permissions.\n4. **Security Review**:\n    - Conduct a security review to validate that the implementation effectively enforces Least Privilege and that there are no unintended access paths.\n5. **Update Dependent Tickets**:\n    - If necessary, revise related tickets to align with the more granular access control model. \n</interpretation> \n",
