**Technical Domain:** Authentication and Authorization, Directory Services
**Complexity:** Medium
**Business Value:** High
**Dependencies:** PingFederate OAuth 2 Server, Active Directory Access

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario:** Successful Login with Active Directory Credentials
**Given** I am an existing user in the Active Directory
**And** I am on the application login page
**When** I enter my valid Active Directory username and password
**Then** I am successfully authenticated and redirected to the application dashboard
**And** My session is secured with an OAuth 2 access token

**Scenario:** Invalid Credentials
**Given** I am on the application login page
**When** I enter invalid Active Directory credentials
**Then** I am shown an error message indicating incorrect credentials
**And** I am not granted access to the application

---

## User Story 2: Machine Client Authenticates with OAuth 2

**Task:** User Story - Authenticate a machine client to access protected resources.
**Description:** As a **System Administrator**, I want to register a machine client and obtain OAuth 2 credentials so that the client can access protected application resources autonomously.
**Technical Domain:** Authentication and Authorization, Identity Provider Integration
**Complexity:** Medium
**Business Value:** High
**Dependencies:** PingFederate OAuth 2 Server

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario:** Successful Client Registration and Token Retrieval
**Given** I am a System Administrator with appropriate permissions

**Then** I receive a client ID and client secret for the registered client
**And** I can use these credentials to obtain an access token via the Client Credentials grant flow

**Scenario:** Unauthorized Client Access
**Given** A machine client attempts to access protected resources
**When** The client provides invalid or missing OAuth 2 credentials
**Then** The request is rejected with an unauthorized error
**And** Access to the protected resource is denied

---

## User Story 3: System Administrator Manages User Access

**Task:** User Story - Manage user access permissions within the application.
**Description:** As a **System Administrator**, I want to manage user access permissions within the application based on their Active Directory groups so that I can control which resources users can access.
**Technical Domain:** Directory Services, Authentication and Authorization
**Complexity:** High
**Business Value:** High
**Dependencies:** Active Directory Access

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario:** Assign User to Application Role Based on AD Group
**Given** I am a System Administrator logged into the application
**And** A user exists in an Active Directory group mapped to a specific application role
**When** I view the user's profile in the application
**Then** The user is assigned the correct application role based on their Active Directory group membership

**Scenario:** User Access Restricted Based on AD Group
**Given** A user belongs to an Active Directory group without access to specific application features
**When** The user attempts to access the restricted feature
**Then** The user is denied access
**And** An error message is displayed indicating insufficient permissions

---

## User Story 4: Retrieve User Information with OpenID Connect

**Task:** User Story - Retrieve user information from Active Directory after successful login.
**Description:** As an **End User**, I want my basic information to be automatically populated in the application after I log in using OpenID Connect so that I don't have to manually enter it.
**Technical Domain:** Authentication and Authorization, OpenID Connect
**Complexity:** Medium
**Business Value:** Medium
**Dependencies:** PingFederate OAuth 2 Server, OpenID Connect Configuration

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario:** Successful User Information Retrieval
**Given** I am successfully authenticated using OpenID Connect
**When** The application requests user information from the OpenID Connect provider
**Then** The provider returns my basic information (e.g., name, email) based on the configured field mappings
**And** The application populates my profile with the retrieved information

**Scenario:** Missing User Attribute Mapping
**Given** The OpenID Connect field mapping is not configured for a specific user attribute
**When** The application requests user information from the OpenID Connect provider
**Then** The provider does not return the missing attribute
**And** The application displays a default value or prompts the user to manually provide the missing information

---

## User Story 5:  Application Handles Token Expiration

**Task:** User Story - Refresh expired access tokens seamlessly.
**Description:** As a **Machine Client**, I want to be able to automatically refresh my access token when it expires so that I can continue accessing protected resources without interruption.
**Technical Domain:** Authentication and Authorization, Python Development
**Complexity:** Medium
**Business Value:** High
**Dependencies:** PingFederate OAuth 2 Server

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario:** Successful Token Refresh
**Given** I am a machine client with a valid refresh token
**When** My access token expires
**Then** The application automatically uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token
**And** I can continue accessing protected resources with the new access token

**Scenario:** Invalid Refresh Token
**Given** I am a machine client with an invalid or expired refresh token
**When** My access token expires and the refresh token is used
**Then** The token refresh request is rejected
**And** The application prompts for re-authentication or handles the error gracefully
