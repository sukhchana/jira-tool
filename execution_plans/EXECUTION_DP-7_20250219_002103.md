        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

<research_findings>
- Python offers robust libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect integration.
- PingFederate provides comprehensive documentation and SDKs for customization.
- Secure configuration and user data handling are crucial for compliance.
- Similar implementations often leverage libraries like Flask-OAuthlib or Django OAuth Toolkit.
</research_findings>
</summary>

<analysis>

<main_objective>
Enable secure authentication for both human and machine users by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-powered Enterprise Active Directory.
</main_objective>

<stakeholders>
- **Application Users:** Both human and machine users who need to authenticate to access the application.
- **System Administrators:** Responsible for the configuration and maintenance of the authentication system.
- **Security Team:** Ensures the implemented solution adheres to security best practices and compliance requirements.
</stakeholders>

<core_requirements>
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the Enterprise Active Directory via PingFederate.
- **User Attribute Mapping:** Define a clear mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
</core_requirements>

<technical_domains>
- **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - **Best Practices:** Implement secure token handling, enforce principle of least privilege, utilize refresh tokens for long-lived access.
    - **Technologies:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Python Integration:**
    - **Best Practices:** Leverage existing Python libraries like Flask-OAuthlib, Django OAuth Toolkit, or requests-oauthlib.
    - **Technologies:** Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC, PingFederate Python SDK (if available)
- **Active Directory and PingFederate:**
    - **Best Practices:** Consult PingFederate documentation for configuration details, utilize secure communication channels (HTTPS), implement proper error handling.
    - **Technologies:** LDAP, PingFederate APIs, potentially SAML for federation if required
</technical_domains>

<dependencies>
- **PingFederate Server:** The existing PingFederate server must be configured to support OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect flows for the application.
- **Active Directory Schema:**  The Active Directory schema should contain the necessary attributes for user identification and attribute mapping.
</dependencies>

<challenges>
- **PingFederate Integration Complexity:** Configuring PingFederate for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect can be complex, requiring specific expertise.
- **Secure Token Management:** Securely storing and managing access tokens and refresh tokens is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.
- **User Attribute Mapping and Synchronization:**  Ensuring consistent and accurate mapping of user attributes between Active Directory and the application can be challenging.
</challenges>

<industry_context>
- **Industry Standards:** OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749), OpenID Connect (OIDC), JSON Web Token (JWT) (RFC 7519)
- **Best Practices:** OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet, NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Compliance Requirements:**  GDPR, CCPA (depending on user data and location)
</industry_context>
