Total Technical Domains: 4
Total Core Requirements: 4
Total Dependencies: 1
Total Challenges: 3
Research Findings: OAuth 2.0 is widely used for authentication and authorization, especially for machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions. Secure implementation is crucial, involving HTTPS, limited scope, secure refresh tokens, and potentially PKCE. Integration with Active Directory is common, often using LDAP or OpenID Connect. Python libraries like OIDC and python-ldap are helpful for implementation.
</summary>

<analysis>
Main Objective: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for the project, integrating with the existing enterprise Active Directory for user identity management. This involves supporting both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication flows.

Stakeholders:
* System Users (Human and Machine)
* System Administrators
* Security Team
* Development Team

Core Requirements:
1.  **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication.
2.  **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the enterprise Active Directory to leverage existing user identities.
3.  **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement a mapping between Active Directory user attributes and the application's user information requirements.
4.  **Secure Communication:** Ensure all communication within the authentication flow is secured using HTTPS.

Technical Domains:
1.  **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Implement the authorization code grant flow with PKCE for human users and the client credentials grant flow for machine-to-machine authentication. Utilize OpenID Connect for user identity retrieval from Active Directory.
2.  **Active Directory Integration:** Leverage LDAP or potentially OpenID Connect to connect and interact with the Active Directory server.
3.  **Python Libraries:** Utilize Python libraries like "requests" for making HTTP requests, "oauthlib" and "requests-oauthlib" for OAuth 2.0 implementation, "python3-openid" for OpenID Connect, and "python-ldap" for LDAP communication.
4.  **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures like input validation, secure token storage, and protection against common OAuth 2.0 attacks.

Dependencies:
1.  **PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server:** The project depends on the existing and operational PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 token issuance and management.

Challenges:
1.  **Secure Token Management:** Securely storing and managing refresh tokens for human users is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.
2.  **User Attribute Mapping Complexity:** Mapping user attributes between Active Directory and the application might require complex transformations or handling of different attribute schemas.
3.  **Potential for Rate Limiting:** Interacting with Active Directory, especially for large user bases, might require implementing mechanisms to handle rate limiting and ensure performance.

Industry Context:
* OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol for authorization, widely used for securing APIs and enabling third-party application access to user data.
* OpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, enabling applications to verify user identities and obtain basic profile information.
* Integrating with existing identity providers like Active Directory is a common practice to streamline user management and leverage existing authentication infrastructure.

        User Stories:
        Story: User Story - Authenticate with Existing Credentials
Description: As a system user (human), I want to authenticate using my existing enterprise Active Directory credentials so that I can access the application without creating a new account.
Technical Domain: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, Active Directory Integration

Story: User Story - Access Resources Securely
Description: As a system user (machine), I want to authenticate using a client credential flow and access specific resources based on my assigned permissions so that I can interact with the application securely and within authorized limits.
Technical Domain: OAuth 2.0, API Security

Story: User Story - Manage User Attributes
Description: As a system administrator, I want to map user attributes from Active Directory to the application so that I can control how user information is used and displayed within the application.
Technical Domain: Active Directory Integration, User Management


        Technical Context:
        Technical Domains:
- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Implement the authorization code grant flow with PKCE for human users and the client credentials grant flow for machine-to-machine authentication. Utilize OpenID Connect for user identity retrieval from Active Directory.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Leverage LDAP or potentially OpenID Connect to connect and interact with the Active Directory server.
- **Python Libraries:** Utilize Python libraries like "requests" for making HTTP requests, "oauthlib" and "requests-oauthlib" for OAuth 2.0 implementation, "python3-openid" for OpenID Connect, and "python-ldap" for LDAP communication.
- **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures like input validation, secure token storage, and protection against common OAuth 2.0 attacks.

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the enterprise Active Directory to leverage existing user identities.
- **Secure Communication:** Ensure all communication within the authentication flow is secured using HTTPS.
