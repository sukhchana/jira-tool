Description: As a **Development Team** member, I want to utilize a Python library to securely communicate with PingFederate's OAuth 2.0 endpoints so that we can implement the authentication flow correctly and securely.
Technical Domain: Python Programming, API Integration


        Technical Context:
        Technical Domains:
- **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP.
- **Python Programming:**  OAuth 2.0/OIDC libraries (e.g., Authlib, requests-oauthlib), Active Directory interaction libraries (e.g., ldap3).
- **API Integration:**  Communication with PingFederate's OAuth 2.0 endpoints.

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to enable secure authentication and authorization.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the existing Active Directory to leverage existing user identities and group memberships for authorization purposes.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect for user identity verification and retrieval of user attributes (e.g., user ID, email) from Active Directory.
- **Python Library Integration:** Identify and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and communication with PingFederate.

        First, provide an implementation strategy:
        <strategy>
        Total Technical Tasks: [number]
        Key Technical Components: [list]
        Implementation Approach: [brief explanation]
        </strategy>

        Then, for each user story, create the necessary technical tasks using EXACTLY this format:

        <technical_task>
        **Task:** Technical Task - [What needs to be built]
        **Description:** [Technical implementation details]

        **Dependencies:** [Related user story or other tasks]
        **Implementation Notes:** [Key technical considerations]
        </technical_task>

        Important Formatting Requirements:
        1. Each task MUST be wrapped in <technical_task> tags
        2. Each field MUST be prefixed with double asterisks and colon (e.g., **Task:**)
        3. Each field MUST be on a new line
        4. Fields MUST appear in the exact order shown above
        5. All fields are required
        6. Use clear, specific titles for tasks
        7. Separate multiple dependencies with commas

        Requirements:
        - Each user story should have 1-2 technical tasks
        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
        - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
        
```

### Raw Response
```
## Implementation Strategy:

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 10
**Key Technical Components:** 
    - OAuth 2.0/OIDC Client Implementation (Python)
    - Active Directory Integration (Python)
    - PingFederate Configuration
    - API Endpoint Security
    - User Interface Integration
**Implementation Approach:** 
    This implementation will leverage a phased approach, starting with core authentication and authorization functionality and then expanding to include user information retrieval and single sign-out. The development team will utilize Python libraries for OAuth 2.0/OIDC communication and Active Directory interaction. Close collaboration with system administrators will be necessary for PingFederate configuration and Active Directory group mapping.
