### Prompt
```

        Please analyze this epic and provide a structured breakdown of its scope.
        You have access to internet search - please use it to:
        1. Research current best practices and technologies relevant to this epic
        2. Identify potential technical challenges or limitations
        3. Find similar implementations or case studies
        4. Stay updated on latest industry standards and compliance requirements

        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

        First, provide a summary of your analysis:

## User Story Generation - User Story - Manage User Roles and Permissions

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for both human and machine users by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-based Enterprise Active Directory.
Stakeholders: - Application Users (Human and Machine)
- System Administrators
- Security Team
Core Requirements: - Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization flows for human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interactions.
- Integrate with the existing PingFederate server for user authentication and authorization.
- Define a mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information.
Technical Domains: - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC):**
- Best Practices:** Utilize well-established Python libraries like `oauthlib` and `requests-oauthlib` for OAuth 2.0 implementation. Leverage `openid-connect-client` or similar libraries for OIDC integration.
- Technologies:** OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant (for human users) and Client Credentials Grant (for machine users). OpenID Connect for user identity retrieval.
- PingFederate Integration:**
- Best Practices:** Consult PingFederate documentation and SDKs for Python integration. Utilize provided libraries and APIs for seamless communication.
- Technologies:** PingFederate REST APIs, potentially PingFederate Agent SDK if available for Python.
- Active Directory Attribute Mapping:**
- Best Practices:** Clearly document the mapping between Active Directory attributes (e.g., sAMAccountName, mail) and application-specific user identifiers.
- Technologies:** Configuration files or database tables to store and manage attribute mapping.
Dependencies: - Existing PingFederate server and its configuration details.
- Access to Active Directory for attribute mapping and potential user synchronization.
Challenges: - Securely handling and storing OAuth 2.0 tokens and secrets.** Implement best practices like secure storage, rotation, and revocation mechanisms.
- Ensuring compatibility and seamless integration between Python libraries, PingFederate, and Active Directory.** Thorough testing and potential customization might be required.
- Managing user sessions and potential single sign-on (SSO) requirements.** Evaluate session management strategies and leverage PingFederate capabilities for SSO if needed.

        REQUIRED FORMAT - Each user story in the array must have these exact fields:
        {
            "title": "User Story - [Descriptive title]",
            "description": "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]",
            "technical_domain": "Primary technical domain this story belongs to",
            "complexity": "Low|Medium|High",
            "business_value": "Low|Medium|High",
            "dependencies": ["dependency1", "dependency2"] or []
        }

        Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text or explanation.
        
```
