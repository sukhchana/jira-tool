- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Support both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication flows using OAuth 2.0.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Utilize the existing Active Directory for user identity verification and retrieval of user details.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:**  Potentially leverage OIDC for user attribute exchange and single sign-on capabilities.
- **Python Library Selection:** Identify and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and Active Directory interaction.

        First, provide an implementation strategy:
        <strategy>
        Total Technical Tasks: [number]
        Key Technical Components: [list]
        Implementation Approach: [brief explanation]
        </strategy>

        Then, for each user story, create the necessary technical tasks using EXACTLY this format:

        </technical_task>

        Important Formatting Requirements:
        1. Each task MUST be wrapped in <technical_task> tags
        2. Each field MUST be prefixed with double asterisks and colon (e.g., **Task:**)
        3. Each field MUST be on a new line
        4. Fields MUST appear in the exact order shown above
        5. All fields are required
        6. Use clear, specific titles for tasks
        7. Separate multiple dependencies with commas

        Requirements:
        - Each user story should have 1-2 technical tasks
        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
        - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
        
```

### Raw Response
```
## Implementation Strategy

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 10
**Key Technical Components:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, Active Directory, JWT, Python (requests-oauthlib, python-ldap, openid-connect-client), Security Monitoring
**Implementation Approach:** 
This implementation will leverage a phased approach, starting with core OAuth 2.0 and Active Directory integration for user authentication. We will then layer on OpenID Connect for enhanced user information exchange and implement JWT for secure token management. Finally, we will integrate security monitoring and logging for the authentication system.
