        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

Research Findings: OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted authorization framework, especially for modern web applications and APIs. It is crucial to adhere to security best practices, such as using HTTPS, limiting scope, and implementing secure token handling. Integration with Active Directory is a common requirement in enterprise environments, often achieved using protocols like LDAP or OpenID Connect. Python offers various libraries and frameworks for implementing OAuth 2.0 and Active Directory integration.
</summary>

<analysis>
Main Objective: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for the Python-based project, integrating with the existing enterprise Active Directory (AD) for user authentication and attribute retrieval.

Stakeholders:

* End-users (human users)
* System administrators
* Development team
* Security team

Core Requirements:

1.  **OAuth 2.0 Authentication:** The system should support OAuth 2.0 for both machine-to-machine (M2M) and human-to-machine (H2M) interactions.
2.  **Active Directory Integration:** Leverage the existing enterprise Active Directory for user authentication and identity information.
3.  **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Implementation:** Utilize OIDC for user attribute retrieval and mapping from Active Directory.
4.  **Python-based Solution:** Implement the authentication mechanism using Python libraries and frameworks.

Technical Domains:

1.  **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:**
    *   **Authorization Grant Type:** Choose an appropriate grant type (Authorization Code Grant recommended for H2M interactions).
    *   **Token Management:** Implement secure storage, retrieval, and refresh mechanisms for access and refresh tokens.
    *   **Python Libraries:** Utilize libraries like `requests-oauthlib` or `Authlib` for OAuth 2.0 functionality.

2.  **Active Directory Integration:**
    *   **LDAP or OpenID Connect:** Determine whether to use LDAP or OIDC for communication with Active Directory. OIDC is generally preferred for modern integrations.
    *   **User Attribute Mapping:** Define clear mapping between Active Directory attributes (e.g., `sAMAccountName`, `mail`) and application-specific user identifiers.
    *   **Python Libraries:** Use libraries like `ldap3` for LDAP or `openid-connect-client` for OIDC integration.

3.  **PING Federate Integration:**
    *   **Configuration:** Configure PING Federate as the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server and OpenID Connect Provider.
    *   **Client Registration:** Register the Python application as a confidential client in PING Federate.
    *   **Scopes and Claims:** Define appropriate scopes and claims to request user information from Active Directory.

4.  **Security Considerations:**
    *   **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication to protect sensitive data.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Token Security:** Store tokens securely, use short expiration times, and implement refresh token rotation.
    *   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to security incidents.

Dependencies:

1.  **PING Federate:** The existing enterprise OAuth 2.0 server and OpenID Connect provider.
2.  **Active Directory:** The enterprise directory service for user authentication and information.

Challenges:

1.  **OIDC and PING Federate Expertise:** Implementing OIDC and configuring PING Federate may require specialized knowledge.
2.  **Attribute Mapping Complexity:** Mapping Active Directory attributes to application-specific identifiers can be complex, especially for large and heterogeneous directory structures.
3.  **Security Implementation:** Ensuring the security of the authentication mechanism and protecting sensitive data requires careful implementation and adherence to best practices.

Industry Context:

*   **OAuth 2.0:** Widely adopted authorization framework, considered an industry standard for delegated authorization.
*   **OpenID Connect:**  A standard layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, specifically designed for authentication and identity information exchange.
*   **Active Directory Integration:** Common requirement in enterprise environments, with various integration approaches and best practices available.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Adhering to industry best practices for secure coding, authentication, and authorization is crucial for protecting sensitive data and systems.
