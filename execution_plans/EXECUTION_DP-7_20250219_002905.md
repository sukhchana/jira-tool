        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

<analysis>
<main_objective>
Enable secure authentication for both human and machine users by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-based Enterprise Active Directory.
</main_objective>

<stakeholders>
- **Application Users:** Both human and machine users who need to authenticate to access the application.
- **System Administrators:** Responsible for managing and maintaining the authentication system and its integration with Active Directory.
</stakeholders>

<core_requirements>
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens for authorized access.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate server to leverage existing user identities and authentication mechanisms.
- **User Data Management:** Define a clear strategy for sourcing user details from Active Directory (potentially using OpenID Connect) and mapping relevant attributes like user ID.
</core_requirements>

<technical_domains>
- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Utilize Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-python` for implementing OAuth 2.0 flows and interacting with OpenID Connect providers.
- **PingFederate Integration:** Leverage PingFederate's API and SDKs (potentially Python-based) to communicate with the existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect endpoints for authentication and user data retrieval.
- **Data Security and Privacy:** Implement robust security measures to protect user data throughout the authentication process, including secure storage of tokens and adherence to data minimization principles.
</technical_domains>

<dependencies>
- **Existing PingFederate Server:** The project relies on the availability and functionality of the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 and Active Directory integration.
- **Active Directory Schema:** Understanding the Active Directory schema and available user attributes is crucial for mapping and retrieving relevant user information.
</dependencies>

<challenges>
- **PingFederate Integration Complexity:** Integrating with PingFederate might require in-depth knowledge of its specific configuration and APIs, potentially demanding significant development and testing effort.
- **Handling Different OAuth 2.0 Flows:** Implementing both Authorization Code Grant and Client Credentials Grant flows adds complexity to the authentication system, requiring careful design and implementation.
- **Security and Compliance:** Ensuring secure handling of user data, including access tokens and user attributes, is paramount. Compliance with industry standards and regulations like GDPR and CCPA is crucial.
</challenges>

<industry_context>
- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Widely adopted industry standards for delegated authorization and authentication, providing a secure and standardized approach.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Common practice for organizations relying on Active Directory for identity management, enabling centralized user management and authentication.
- **Data Security and Privacy:**  Regulations like GDPR and CCPA mandate strict requirements for collecting, storing, and processing user data, emphasizing the need for secure and compliant implementations.

## User Story Generation - User Story - Enable Machine-to-Machine Communication

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for both human and machine users by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-based Enterprise Active Directory.
Technical Domains:
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Utilize Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-python` for implementing OAuth 2.0 flows and interacting with OpenID Connect providers.
- PingFederate Integration:** Leverage PingFederate's API and SDKs (potentially Python-based) to communicate with the existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect endpoints for authentication and user data retrieval.
- Data Security and Privacy:** Implement robust security measures to protect user data throughout the authentication process, including secure storage of tokens and adherence to data minimization principles.
Core Requirements:
- OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens for authorized access.
- Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate server to leverage existing user identities and authentication mechanisms.
- User Data Management:** Define a clear strategy for sourcing user details from Active Directory (potentially using OpenID Connect) and mapping relevant attributes like user ID.
Stakeholders:
- Application Users:** Both human and machine users who need to authenticate to access the application.
- System Administrators:** Responsible for managing and maintaining the authentication system and its integration with Active Directory.

      "pain_points": "- Lack of Personalization: Without access to user details, the application cannot offer a personalized experience, leading to lower user satisfaction and engagement. - Weak Authorization: Inability to retrieve user groups and roles hinders the enforcement of fine-grained authorization policies, posing security risks. - Manual Data Entry: Users might be required to provide information already present in Active Directory, leading to a cumbersome experience and potential data inconsistencies.",
      "success_metrics": "- Time to Retrieve User Data: Measure the time taken to fetch and map user details after authentication. Aim for a sub-second response time. - Personalization Success Rate: Track the percentage of users experiencing personalized content or features based on retrieved data. - Authorization Accuracy: Monitor the accuracy of authorization decisions based on user roles and groups fetched from Active Directory. - Reduction in Support Requests: Observe any decrease in user support requests related to login issues, data discrepancies, or access control.",
      "similar_implementations": "- Auth0 User Profile: Auth0 allows retrieving user profile information from various identity providers, including Active Directory, using its API. - Keycloak User Storage SPI: Keycloak offers a User Storage SPI (Service Provider Interface) to connect with external user stores like Active Directory for user authentication and data retrieval. - Okta User API: Okta's User API enables developers to manage and retrieve user data, including profile information and group memberships.",
      "modern_approaches": "- OpenID Connect (OIDC): Leverage OIDC, a modern authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, to securely retrieve user information using standardized scopes and claims. - JSON Web Token (JWT): Utilize JWTs to securely transmit user information between the application and PingFederate after authentication. - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Implement ABAC to define fine-grained authorization policies based on user attributes retrieved from Active Directory, enabling dynamic and context-aware access control. - Zero Trust Security: Adhere to Zero Trust principles by verifying user identities and authorizations for every request, even within the application, to enhance security posture."
