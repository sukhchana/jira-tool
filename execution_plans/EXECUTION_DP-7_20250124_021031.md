**Main Objective:** 
Enable secure authentication and authorization for the Python application by implementing OAuth 2.0, leveraging the existing enterprise OAuth 2.0 server (PingFederate) and integrating with the Enterprise Active Directory for user identity management.

**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:**  Those who will use the application and authenticate through OAuth 2.0.
* **Application Developers:** Responsible for implementing the authentication mechanism within the application.
* **Security Team:**  Oversees security policies and ensures the implementation aligns with organizational standards.
* **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Team:** Manages the Active Directory and PingFederate.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code flow for human users and Client Credentials flow for machine-to-machine) within the Python application.
2. **Active Directory Integration:**  Establish a secure connection to the Active Directory to validate user credentials and retrieve user information.
3. **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration (Potential):**  Utilize OIDC for user attribute exchange, obtaining user details like user ID, email, etc., from Active Directory after successful authentication.
4. **PingFederate Integration:**  Configure the application as a client within PingFederate, defining scopes, access levels, and other necessary settings.

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2. **Identity Management:** Active Directory, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
3. **API Security:**  Secure communication with PingFederate and potentially Active Directory.
4. **Python Development:** Utilizing Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and Active Directory interaction (e.g., `requests-oauthlib`, `openid-connect`, `ldap3`).

**Dependencies:**

1. **PingFederate:**  Availability and proper configuration of the PingFederate server.
2. **Active Directory:**  Access permissions and necessary attributes available for the application.

**Challenges:**

1. **Complexity of OAuth 2.0 and OIDC:** Implementing these protocols correctly can be complex, requiring careful attention to security considerations.
2. **Integration with Existing Systems:**  Seamlessly integrating with PingFederate and Active Directory might pose technical hurdles.
3. **Python Library Selection and Implementation:** Choosing the right Python libraries and ensuring their correct and secure implementation is crucial.

## Implementation Strategy

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 10
**Key Technical Components:**
- OAuth 2.0/OIDC Client Library Integration
- PingFederate Client Configuration
- Active Directory Connection and User Validation
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation
- Secure API Endpoints
- User Session Management
- Audit Logging System
- Frontend Authentication Integration
- Configuration Management
- End-to-End Testing Framework

**Implementation Approach:**

This implementation will follow an iterative approach, focusing on core authentication and authorization functionality first, then expanding to cover user management, role-based access control, and audit logging. We will leverage existing Python libraries for OAuth 2.0/OIDC, Active Directory interaction, and API security.  A robust testing framework will be developed alongside the application to ensure security and reliability.
