        Please analyze this epic and provide a structured breakdown of its scope.

        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

## Epic Analysis: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

<summary>
Total Technical Domains: **4**
Total Core Requirements: **5**
Total Dependencies: **2**
Total Challenges: **3**
</summary>

<analysis>

**Main Objective:** 

Enable secure authentication and authorization within the Python application by implementing OAuth 2.0, leveraging the existing enterprise OAuth 2 server (PingFederate) and integrating with the Enterprise Active Directory for user identity management.

**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:** Employees requiring access to the application.
* **Security Team:** Responsible for overall security posture and compliance.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the authentication solution.
* **IT Operations:** Responsible for managing the Active Directory and PingFederate infrastructure.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) for secure authentication.
2. **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with Active Directory to leverage existing user identities and attributes.
3. **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:** Utilize OIDC for user identity verification and attribute retrieval from Active Directory.
4. **User Attribute Mapping:** Define clear mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
5. **Python Library Integration:** Select and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and Active Directory communication.

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2. **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP.
3. **Python Programming:** Relevant libraries (e.g., requests-oauthlib, python-ldap, pyjwt).
4. **Security:** Secure configuration, token handling, and best practices.

**Dependencies:**

1. **Enterprise OAuth 2 Server (PingFederate):** Availability and proper configuration for integration.
2. **Active Directory:** Accessibility and permission to query user information.

**Challenges:**

1. **Complexity of OAuth 2.0 and OIDC:** Implementing and configuring these protocols correctly can be challenging.
2. **Integration with Existing Systems:** Ensuring seamless integration with PingFederate and Active Directory might require significant effort.
3. **Security Considerations:** Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive information throughout the authentication process is crucial.
