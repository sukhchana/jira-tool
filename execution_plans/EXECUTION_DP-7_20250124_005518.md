        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

## Epic Analysis: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

<summary>

</summary>

<analysis>

**Main Objective:** 

Enable secure authentication and authorization for the Python application by implementing OAuth 2.0 protocol and integrating with the existing enterprise Active Directory (AD) using OpenID Connect (OIDC). This should support both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions, leveraging existing user identities in Active Directory.

**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:** Employees and potentially external users who need to access the application.
* **Security Team:** Responsible for overall security posture and compliance.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* **IT Operations:** Responsible for managing the Active Directory and PingFederate infrastructure.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens for authorized access.
2. **OpenID Connect Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect for user authentication and identity retrieval from Active Directory.
3. **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement mapping between Active Directory user attributes and application-specific user roles and permissions.
4. **PingFederate Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate server as the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider.

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
2. **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP
3. **Identity Provider:** PingFederate
4. **Backend Development:** Python, relevant OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect libraries

**Dependencies:**

1. **Existing Enterprise Active Directory:**  The application relies on the existing Active Directory for user information.
2. **PingFederate Server:** The project depends on the availability and proper configuration of the PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect services.

**Challenges:**

1. **Python Library Selection:** Identifying and integrating the appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and PingFederate interaction.
2. **Attribute Mapping Complexity:**  Ensuring accurate and efficient mapping of user attributes between Active Directory and the application.
3. **Security Considerations:** Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive user data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes secure storage and handling of tokens, proper input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities.

Then the user is successfully authenticated and redirected to the application dashboard
And the user's Active Directory attributes are mapped to the application roles and permissions

Scenario: Invalid Credentials Login Attempt
Given an End User is on the application login page
When the user enters incorrect Active Directory credentials
Then the user is shown an "Invalid username or password" error message
And the user is not granted access to the application
</user_story>

Then the user is granted access based on their group membership

Scenario: User Denied Access Based on Group Membership
Given an End User does not belong to any Active Directory group authorized to access a specific application resource
When the user attempts to access the resource
Then the user is denied access and receives an "Unauthorized" error message
</user_story>

<user_story>
Task: User Story - Configure and manage OAuth 2.0 flows for machine-to-machine communication.
Description: As a **Development Team** member, I want to configure and manage OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow for machine-to-machine communication within the application so that internal services can securely interact with each other without requiring user intervention.

<user_story>
Task: User Story -  Revoke application access upon employee termination.
Description: As a **Security Team** member, I want to automatically revoke an employee's access to the application upon their termination in Active Directory so that I can prevent unauthorized access from former employees and maintain a secure application environment.
Technical Domain: Directory Services, Authentication & Authorization
Complexity: Medium
Business Value: High
Dependencies: Active Directory, PingFederate

Scenarios:
Scenario: Access Revoked After Termination
Given an employee's account is deactivated in Active Directory

        Technical Context:
        Technical Domains:
- **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP
- **Identity Provider:** PingFederate
- **Backend Development:** Python, relevant OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect libraries

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens for authorized access.
- **OpenID Connect Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect for user authentication and identity retrieval from Active Directory.
- **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement mapping between Active Directory user attributes and application-specific user roles and permissions.
- **PingFederate Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate server as the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider.

### Raw Response
```
## Implementation Strategy:

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 10
**Key Technical Components:** OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect Integration, Active Directory Synchronization, User Attribute Mapping, Role-Based Access Control, PingFederate Configuration, JWT Validation, Backend API Development, Frontend Authentication Integration

**Implementation Approach:**

This implementation will utilize a phased approach, starting with core authentication and authorization functionalities and then expanding to cover machine-to-machine communication and user management features.

**Phase 1: Core Authentication and Authorization**

- Configure PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow for user authentication.
- Integrate OpenID Connect for user identity retrieval from Active Directory.
- Develop backend API endpoints for handling authentication and authorization.
- Implement frontend logic for redirecting users to PingFederate for login and handling authentication responses.

**Phase 2:  Machine-to-Machine Communication and User Management**

- Implement OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow for machine-to-machine communication.
- Develop backend logic for managing and validating OAuth 2.0 tokens.
- Design and implement user attribute mapping between Active Directory and application roles.
- Build frontend functionalities for viewing authorized applications and managing access.

This phased approach allows for iterative development, testing, and deployment, ensuring a robust and secure authentication and authorization system.
