        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

## User Story Generation - User Story - Automate System Integration

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions using OAuth 2 and integrate with the existing enterprise Active Directory for user identity management.
Stakeholders: - Application Users (both human and machine)
- System Administrators
- Security Team
Core Requirements: - Implement OAuth 2 authorization flows for machine-to-machine and human-to-machine communication.
- Integrate with the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect functionality.
- Map Active Directory user attributes to application roles and permissions.
Technical Domains: - OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC):**
- Best Practices:**
- Use authorization code flow for confidential clients (e.g., web applications).
- Use client credentials flow for machine-to-machine communication.
- Implement OpenID Connect for user authentication and attribute retrieval.
- Securely store and manage client secrets and access tokens.
- Technologies:**
- Flask-OAuthlib (Python library for OAuth 2)
- python-jose (Python library for JWT handling)
- Active Directory Integration:**
- Best Practices:**
- Use LDAP or secure LDAP (LDAPS) for communication with Active Directory.
- Implement proper error handling and logging for authentication and authorization requests.
- Define a clear mapping between Active Directory attributes and application roles/permissions.
- Technologies:**
- ldap3 (Python library for LDAP)
- Python Development:**
- Best Practices:**
- Use a secure coding framework like Flask or Django.
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and security of the authentication and authorization logic.
- Technologies:**
- Flask/Django (web frameworks)
- pytest (testing framework)
Dependencies: - Existing PingFederate server and its configuration for OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect.
- Access to Active Directory for user authentication and attribute retrieval.
Challenges: - Complexity of OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect:** Implementing these protocols correctly can be challenging, requiring a deep understanding of their intricacies.
- Integration with Existing Systems:** Integrating with PingFederate and Active Directory might require specific configurations and knowledge of their APIs.
- Security Considerations:** Ensuring the security of the authentication and authorization process is paramount, requiring careful attention to token management, consent management, and potential attack vectors.

        REQUIRED FORMAT - Each user story in the array must have these exact fields:
        {
            "title": "User Story - [Descriptive title]",
            "description": "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]",
            "technical_domain": "Primary technical domain this story belongs to",
            "complexity": "Low|Medium|High",
            "business_value": "Low|Medium|High",
            "dependencies": ["dependency1", "dependency2"] or []
        }

        Return ONLY the JSON array, no additional text or explanation.

## Technical Tasks Generation

### Prompt
```

        Please create technical tasks based on these user stories and epic analysis.
        Focus on implementation details, system architecture, and technical requirements.
        When specifying dependencies, use the Story ID to reference user stories.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions using OAuth 2 and integrate with the existing enterprise Active Directory for user identity management.
Stakeholders:
- Application Users (both human and machine)
- System Administrators
- Security Team
Core Requirements:
- Implement OAuth 2 authorization flows for machine-to-machine and human-to-machine communication.
- Integrate with the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect functionality.
- Map Active Directory user attributes to application roles and permissions.
Technical Domains:
- OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC):**
- Best Practices:**
- Use authorization code flow for confidential clients (e.g., web applications).
- Use client credentials flow for machine-to-machine communication.
- Implement OpenID Connect for user authentication and attribute retrieval.
- Securely store and manage client secrets and access tokens.
- Technologies:**
- Flask-OAuthlib (Python library for OAuth 2)
- python-jose (Python library for JWT handling)
- Active Directory Integration:**
- Best Practices:**
- Use LDAP or secure LDAP (LDAPS) for communication with Active Directory.
- Implement proper error handling and logging for authentication and authorization requests.
- Define a clear mapping between Active Directory attributes and application roles/permissions.
- Technologies:**
- ldap3 (Python library for LDAP)
- Python Development:**
- Best Practices:**
- Use a secure coding framework like Flask or Django.
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding to prevent vulnerabilities.
- Write unit tests to ensure the functionality and security of the authentication and authorization logic.
- Technologies:**
- Flask/Django (web frameworks)
- pytest (testing framework)
Dependencies:
- Existing PingFederate server and its configuration for OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect.
- Access to Active Directory for user authentication and attribute retrieval.
Challenges:
- Complexity of OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect:** Implementing these protocols correctly can be challenging, requiring a deep understanding of their intricacies.
- Integration with Existing Systems:** Integrating with PingFederate and Active Directory might require specific configurations and knowledge of their APIs.
- Security Considerations:** Ensuring the security of the authentication and authorization process is paramount, requiring careful attention to token management, consent management, and potential attack vectors.
Industry Context:
- Industry Standards:**
- OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749)
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) 1.0
- Best Practices:**
- OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Compliance Requirements:**
- GDPR (for user data privacy)
- Industry-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare)
Total Technical Domains: 3
Total Core Requirements: 3
Total Dependencies: 2
Total Challenges: 3
Research Findings: - OAuth 2 is well-suited for this use case, offering flexibility and security.
    - OpenID Connect (OIDC) is the recommended approach for user authentication with Active Directory.
    - Python libraries like Flask-OAuthlib and python-jose simplify OAuth 2 and OIDC integration.
    - PingFederate provides robust OAuth 2 and OIDC capabilities, including user provisioning and authorization.
    - Security considerations like token management, consent management, and attack mitigation are crucial.
