        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

<summary>
Total Technical Domains: **4**
Total Core Requirements: **5**
Total Dependencies: **2**
Total Challenges: **3**
</summary>

<analysis>

**Main Objective:** 
Enable secure authentication and authorization for the Python application by implementing OAuth 2.0, leveraging the existing enterprise OAuth 2.0 server (PingFederate) and integrating with the Enterprise Active Directory for user identity management.

**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:** Employees requiring access to the application.
* **Security Team:** Responsible for overall security posture and compliance.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the authentication solution.
* **IT Operations:** Responsible for deploying and maintaining the application and its dependencies.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant or Implicit Grant for human-to-machine, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) for secure authentication.
2. **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with Active Directory using a protocol like OpenID Connect (OIDC) to leverage existing user identities.
3. **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
4. **PingFederate Integration:** Configure the application to interact with the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server for token issuance and validation.
5. **Python Library Selection:** Choose and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support (e.g., requests-oauthlib, oauthlib, pyoidc).

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2. **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP.
3. **Identity Provider Integration:** PingFederate configuration and API interaction.
4. **Python Development:** Relevant libraries, frameworks, and best practices.

**Dependencies:**

1. **Enterprise Active Directory:** Availability and accessibility for user information retrieval.
2. **PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server:**  Availability, proper configuration, and documentation for integration.

**Challenges:**

1. **Complexity of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Implementing these protocols correctly requires a thorough understanding of their intricacies.
2. **Integration Testing:** Ensuring seamless integration between the application, Active Directory, and PingFederate will require comprehensive testing.
3. **Security Considerations:** Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive user data and prevent unauthorized access is crucial.

- **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP.
- **Identity Provider Integration:** PingFederate configuration and API interaction.
- **Python Development:** Relevant libraries, frameworks, and best practices.

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant or Implicit Grant for human-to-machine, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) for secure authentication.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with Active Directory using a protocol like OpenID Connect (OIDC) to leverage existing user identities.
- **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
- **PingFederate Integration:** Configure the application to interact with the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server for token issuance and validation.
- **Python Library Selection:** Choose and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support (e.g., requests-oauthlib, oauthlib, pyoidc).

        First, provide an implementation strategy:
        <strategy>
        Total Technical Tasks: [number]
        Key Technical Components: [list]
        Implementation Approach: [brief explanation]
        </strategy>

        Then, for each user story, create the necessary technical tasks using EXACTLY this format:

        Important Formatting Requirements:
        1. Each task MUST be wrapped in <technical_task> tags
        2. Each field MUST be prefixed with double asterisks and colon (e.g., **Task:**)
        3. Each field MUST be on a new line
        4. Fields MUST appear in the exact order shown above
        5. All fields are required
        6. Use clear, specific titles for tasks
        7. Separate multiple dependencies with commas

        Requirements:
        - Each user story should have 1-2 technical tasks
        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
        - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
        
```
