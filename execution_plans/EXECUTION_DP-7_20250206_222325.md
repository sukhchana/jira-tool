  "changes_interpreted": "<interpretation>\n\n**Requested Changes:**\n1.  Clarify that the backend implementation for access control logic must be done using Python. \n\n**Impact Analysis:**\n- **Fields to Modify:** \n    -  `description`: Add a sentence specifying the use of Python for implementation.\n    -  `required_skills`:  Add \"Python\" if not already present. \n- **Dependencies Affected:**  No. The core dependency on the API endpoint for group membership remains unchanged. However, the implementation details of this endpoint might need to consider Python's interaction with it.\n- **Related Tickets Impact:**  \n    -  \"Implement API Endpoint for Group Membership Retrieval\":  Potentially, if this endpoint's design hasn't been finalized, it might need adjustments to be compatible with Python.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n1. **Update Ticket Description:**  Modify the `description` field in the JIRA ticket to include a clear statement like \"Implement logic **in Python** in the backend...\".\n2. **Review Required Skills:** Ensure the `required_skills` field includes \"Python\". If not, add it.\n3. **Communicate with Dependent Ticket Owners:** If the API endpoint for group membership retrieval is still under development, discuss the Python implementation detail with the responsible team to ensure compatibility. \n4. **No changes to acceptance criteria**: The acceptance criteria remain valid as they focus on the functionality, not the implementation language. \n</interpretation> \n",
