        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

        <research_findings>OAuth 2.0 is a powerful authorization framework widely used for modern applications. It is crucial to prioritize security best practices when implementing OAuth 2.0, such as using HTTPS for all communications, adhering to the principle of least privilege, securely managing refresh tokens, and implementing token revocation mechanisms. PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is highly recommended for enhancing security, especially for public clients like mobile or single-page applications.

        - **Similar Implementations:** Many web applications and services offer social login options (Google, Facebook, etc.) which function similarly to AD-based login.
        - **UX Patterns:** A dedicated "Login with AD" button is common, often alongside other social login options. Clear communication about data access is crucial.
        - **Challenges:** Handling different AD configurations, potential latency in AD communication, ensuring secure token handling.
        - **Accessibility:** Providing alternative text for login buttons, ensuring keyboard navigation is possible.
        - **Integration Opportunities:** Leverage existing OpenID Connect libraries and PingFederate's capabilities for streamlined integration.

    <description>As a system administrator, I want to enable secure communication between internal applications using OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant so that data exchange is protected without user intervention.</description>
    <story_points>8</story_points>
    <research_summary>
        - **Similar Implementations:** Microservices architectures often rely on OAuth 2.0 client credentials for secure inter-service communication.
        - **Best Practices:** Use short-lived access tokens, rotate client secrets regularly, and implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
        - **Challenges:** Securely storing and managing client secrets, handling token revocation, and ensuring proper logging and monitoring.
        - **Accessibility:** Not directly applicable as this is a backend-focused story.
        - **Integration Opportunities:** Leverage PingFederate's client management capabilities and integrate with existing logging and monitoring tools.

        - **Similar Implementations:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a common pattern in web applications for managing user permissions.

        - **Accessibility:** Using ARIA attributes for roles and permissions tables, providing keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Technical Tasks Generation

### Prompt
```

        Please create technical tasks based on these user stories and epic analysis.
        Focus on implementation details, system architecture, and technical requirements.
        When specifying dependencies, use the Story ID to reference user stories.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: The main objective of this epic is to enhance the application's security and user experience by implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine (M2M) and human-to-machine (H2M) interactions. This involves integrating with the existing enterprise Active Directory (AD) using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for user identity verification and management.
Stakeholders:
- Application Users (Human and Machine)
- System Administrators
- Security Team
- Development Team
Core Requirements:
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both M2M and H2M interactions.
- Integrate with the enterprise Active Directory (AD) for user authentication and identity management.
- Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to securely obtain user details from AD.
- Develop a Python-based solution that seamlessly integrates with the existing application and the PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server.
Technical Domains:
- OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Utilize a suitable Python OAuth 2.0 library (e.g., OAuthLib, Authlib) to handle the authentication flow, including authorization code exchange, token management, and secure communication with the PingFederate server.
- Active Directory Integration:** Leverage Python libraries like python-ldap or pywin32 to interact with Active Directory. This involves querying AD for user details using OpenID Connect and mapping AD attributes to application-specific user roles and permissions.
- Security Best Practices:** Implement robust security measures, including HTTPS for all communications, input validation, protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting, SQL injection), and adherence to the principle of least privilege.
- Python Development:** Follow Python best practices for code structure, documentation, and testing. Ensure the solution is well-integrated with the existing application and adheres to coding standards.
Dependencies:
- PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server: The project relies on the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 token issuance and management.
Challenges:
- Complexity of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect correctly can be complex, requiring a thorough understanding of the protocols, security considerations, and best practices.
- Integration with Existing Systems:** Integrating with the existing application, Active Directory, and PingFederate server may pose challenges in terms of compatibility, data mapping, and potential conflicts.
- Security Risks:** Implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms always introduces security risks. It's crucial to address potential vulnerabilities, such as token leakage, replay attacks, and unauthorized access.
Industry Context:
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Standards:** Adhering to the latest OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards and best practices is essential for security and interoperability.
- Security Compliance:** Depending on the industry and data sensitivity, compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS might be necessary.
- Python Libraries and Frameworks:** Leveraging well-established Python libraries and frameworks for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and Active Directory integration can streamline development and enhance security.

Research Findings: OAuth 2.0 is a powerful authorization framework widely used for modern applications. It is crucial to prioritize security best practices when implementing OAuth 2.0, such as using HTTPS for all communications, adhering to the principle of least privilege, securely managing refresh tokens, and implementing token revocation mechanisms. PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is highly recommended for enhancing security, especially for public clients like mobile or single-page applications. Additionally, performance considerations like token validation and expiration should be carefully addressed. When integrating with Active Directory, Python offers various libraries like python-ldap and pywin32 for seamless interaction. For enhanced data processing and integration, utilizing tools like the CData Python Connector for Active Directory with frameworks like petl can significantly streamline development.

        <architecture>The application will redirect users to the PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server for authentication. Upon successful authentication, PingFederate will issue an authorization code, which the application will exchange for access and refresh tokens. These tokens will be used for subsequent API requests.</architecture>

        <database>No database changes required for this task.</database>
        <security>Implement HTTPS for all communication. Use a secure method for storing and managing refresh tokens. Validate tokens and implement appropriate error handling for invalid or expired tokens.</security>
