        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

### Analysis

```xml
<analysis>
  <main_objective>
    Enable secure authentication and authorization for the Python application by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-based Enterprise Active Directory.
  </main_objective>

  <stakeholders>
    - Application Users (Human and Machine)
    - System Administrators
    - Security Team
  </stakeholders>

  <core_requirements>
    - Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow for human users.
    - Implement OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant flow for machine-to-machine authentication.
    - Integrate with PingFederate for user authentication and token issuance.
    - Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to retrieve user information from Active Directory.
  </core_requirements>

  <technical_domains>
    - **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC):**
      - **Best Practices:**
        - Use a well-established Python library like `authlib` or `requests-oauthlib`.
        - Implement appropriate security measures for token handling and validation.
        - Adhere to OAuth 2.0 and OIDC specifications.
      - **Technologies:**
        - Authlib: https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/
        - Requests-OAuthlib: https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    - **PingFederate Integration:**
      - **Best Practices:**
        - Consult PingFederate documentation for integration guides and best practices.
        - Utilize PingFederate SDKs for Python if available.
        - Configure PingFederate to act as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and OpenID Connect provider.
      - **Resources:**
        - PingFederate Documentation: https://docs.pingidentity.com/pingfederate
    - **Active Directory Integration:**
      - **Best Practices:**
        - Define clear attribute mapping between Active Directory and the application.
        - Implement user provisioning and de-provisioning mechanisms if required.
        - Securely store and manage any credentials used for Active Directory communication.
  </technical_domains>

  <dependencies>
    - Existing PingFederate instance configured as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and OpenID Connect provider.
    - Access to Active Directory for user information retrieval.
  </dependencies>

  <challenges>
    - **Integration Complexity:** Integrating multiple systems (Python application, PingFederate, Active Directory) can be complex and require careful planning and testing.
    - **Security Considerations:** Implementing secure token handling, storage, and validation is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities.
    - **Attribute Mapping and User Provisioning:** Defining clear attribute mapping between systems and handling user provisioning/de-provisioning can be challenging.
  </challenges>

  <industry_context>
    - **Industry Standards:**
      - OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749): https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749
      - OpenID Connect (OIDC): https://openid.net/connect/
    - **Best Practices:**
      - OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html
      - NIST Digital Identity Guidelines: https://pages.nist.gov/800-63/
    - **Compliance Requirements:**
      - GDPR (if applicable): https://gdpr.eu/
      - Other relevant regulations depending on industry and location.
