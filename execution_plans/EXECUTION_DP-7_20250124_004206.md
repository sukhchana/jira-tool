        Please analyze this epic and provide a structured breakdown of its scope.

        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

**Main Objective:** 
Enable secure authentication and authorization for the Python application by implementing OAuth 2.0, integrating with the existing enterprise Active Directory (AD) using OpenID Connect (OIDC), and leveraging the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server.

**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:**  Those who will authenticate with the application.
* **Application Developers:** Responsible for implementing the authentication mechanism.
* **Security Team:** Responsible for ensuring the security of the authentication process.
* **IT/Infrastructure Team:** Manages the Active Directory and PingFederate infrastructure.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code flow for human users and Client Credentials flow for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens for authorized access to protected resources.
2. **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the existing Active Directory using OpenID Connect (OIDC) to leverage existing user identities and group memberships for authorization.
3. **User Attribute Mapping:** Define a clear mapping between Active Directory user attributes (e.g., sAMAccountName, email) and application-specific user identifiers and roles.
4. **PingFederate Integration:** Configure and utilize the existing PingFederate server as the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server and OpenID Connect Provider.

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
2. **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP
3. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** PingFederate configuration and integration
4. **Python Development:**  Libraries for OAuth 2.0/OIDC client implementation (e.g., requests-oauthlib, oauthlib)

**Dependencies:**

1. **Existing Active Directory:**  The application relies on the existing Active Directory for user information.
2. **PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server:** The existing PingFederate server must be configured to support the application's OAuth 2.0 and OIDC requirements.

**Challenges:**

1. **Complexity of OAuth 2.0 and OIDC:** Implementing and integrating these protocols correctly can be complex, requiring careful attention to security best practices.
2. **Potential Performance Impacts:** Integrating with Active Directory and PingFederate could introduce latency, impacting application performance.
3. **Python Library Selection and Integration:** Choosing the right Python libraries for OAuth 2.0/OIDC and integrating them seamlessly into the application is crucial.
