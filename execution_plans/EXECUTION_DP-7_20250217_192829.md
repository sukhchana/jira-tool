        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

        <research_findings>OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are widely used for authentication and identity management. PKCE is crucial for mobile and single-page applications. Securely handling tokens, implementing refresh and revocation mechanisms, and adhering to industry standards like HTTPS are essential. Python offers libraries like python-ldap for Active Directory interaction and various OAuth 2.0 client libraries. </research_findings>

<analysis>
        <main_objective>
        The epic aims to enhance the application's security and user experience by implementing OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine (M2M) and human-to-machine (H2M) interactions. The system will integrate with the existing enterprise Active Directory (AD) for user identity management, leveraging OpenID Connect for sourcing user details.
        </main_objective>

        <stakeholders>
        - Application Users (Human and Machine)
        - System Administrators
        - Security Team
        </stakeholders>

        <core_requirements>
        - Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both M2M and H2M communication.
        - Integrate with the enterprise Active Directory (AD) for user authentication and identity management.
        - Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to retrieve user details from AD, defining field mapping for user attributes.
        - Develop the solution using Python, leveraging appropriate libraries and frameworks.
        </core_requirements>

        <technical_domains>
        - Authentication and Authorization: Implement OAuth 2.0 flows, including authorization code grant with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for enhanced security, especially for machine-to-machine communication.
        - Identity Management: Integrate with the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server, ensuring proper configuration and adherence to security standards.
        - Active Directory Integration: Utilize Python libraries like python-ldap to interact with Active Directory for user authentication and retrieval of user attributes.
        - Security: Implement secure token handling, storage, and validation. Consider token revocation mechanisms, refresh tokens, and adherence to industry best practices for secure communication (HTTPS).
        </technical_domains>

        <dependencies>
        - PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server: The project relies on the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 token issuance and management.
        </dependencies>

        <challenges>
        - Securely handling OAuth 2.0 tokens in a Python environment, especially for M2M communication where token storage requires careful consideration.
        - Mapping user attributes from Active Directory to the application, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
        - Potential performance implications of integrating with Active Directory, requiring optimization strategies for user authentication and data retrieval.
        </challenges>

        <industry_context>
        - OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are industry-standard protocols for authentication and identity management, ensuring interoperability and security.
        - Adhering to best practices for secure communication (HTTPS), token management, and user data privacy is crucial for compliance and user trust.
        - Regularly updating dependencies, particularly security-related libraries, is essential to mitigate vulnerabilities and stay current with industry standards.
