  "changes_interpreted": "<interpretation>\n\n**Requested Changes:**\n1.  Clarify that the backend implementation for access control logic must be done using Python.\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\n- **Fields to Modify:** \n    -  `description`: Add a sentence specifying the use of Python for implementation.\n    -  `required_skills`:  Add \"Python\" to the list of required skills. \n- **Dependencies Affected:** No. The core dependency remains on the API endpoint for group membership retrieval. The programming language used for implementation doesn't change this dependency.\n- **Related Tickets Impact:**  Potentially none. However, if there are other tickets directly related to the backend implementation of this feature, they might be indirectly impacted if they were assuming a different programming language. \n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n1. **Update Ticket Description:**  Modify the `description` field in the JIRA ticket to include a statement like: \"This implementation should be done using Python.\"\n2. **Update Required Skills:** Add \"Python\" to the `required_skills` field.\n3. **Notify Assignee (Optional):** If the ticket is already assigned, notify the assignee about the language specification.\n4. **Review Related Tickets (Optional):** Check for other tickets with direct dependencies on this one, particularly those related to backend implementation, and assess if any updates are needed based on the Python specification. \n</interpretation> \n",
