        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

<analysis>
<main_objective>
Enable secure authentication for both human and machine users by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-based Enterprise Active Directory.
</main_objective>

<stakeholders>
- **Application Users:** Both human and machine users who need to authenticate to access the application.
- **System Administrators:** Responsible for maintaining and managing the authentication system and Active Directory integration.
</stakeholders>

<core_requirements>
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to secure the application.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate server to authenticate users against the Enterprise Active Directory.
- **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement a mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
</core_requirements>

<technical_domains>
- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Utilize Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-client` for handling OAuth 2.0 flows and OpenID Connect interactions.
- **PingFederate Integration:** Leverage PingFederate's Python SDK or REST APIs to communicate with the existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider for authentication and user information retrieval.
- **Active Directory Integration:**  Understand and implement best practices for secure communication and data exchange with Active Directory, potentially using LDAP or other relevant protocols.
</technical_domains>

<dependencies>
- **Existing PingFederate Server:** The project relies on the availability and functionality of the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect services.
- **Active Directory Schema:**  Knowledge of the Active Directory schema is crucial for mapping user attributes correctly.
</dependencies>

<challenges>
- **Security Considerations:** Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive user data during authentication and authorization is paramount.
- **Attribute Mapping Complexity:**  Mapping Active Directory attributes to application-specific user information might require complex transformations or custom logic.
- **PingFederate Integration:**  Seamless integration with PingFederate, including configuration and potential customization, might pose technical challenges.
</challenges>

<industry_context>
- **OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749):**  Adhering to the OAuth 2.0 specification ensures interoperability and security best practices.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC):**  Implementing OIDC alongside OAuth 2.0 provides a standardized way to obtain user information securely.
- **Security Best Practices:** Following OWASP guidelines for authentication and authorization is crucial to mitigate security risks.
- **Data Privacy Regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA):**  Comply with relevant data privacy regulations when handling user data obtained from Active Directory.

## User Story Generation - User Story - Access Application Programmatically with Machine Identity

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for both human and machine users by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-based Enterprise Active Directory.
Technical Domains:
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Utilize Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-client` for handling OAuth 2.0 flows and OpenID Connect interactions.
- PingFederate Integration:** Leverage PingFederate's Python SDK or REST APIs to communicate with the existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider for authentication and user information retrieval.
- Active Directory Integration:**  Understand and implement best practices for secure communication and data exchange with Active Directory, potentially using LDAP or other relevant protocols.
Core Requirements:
- OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to secure the application.
- Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate server to authenticate users against the Enterprise Active Directory.
- User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement a mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
Stakeholders:
- Application Users:** Both human and machine users who need to authenticate to access the application.
- System Administrators:** Responsible for maintaining and managing the authentication system and Active Directory integration.

      "pain_points": "- Lack of Personalized Experiences: Without retrieving user information, applications cannot tailor the user interface or provide personalized content. - Inefficient Access Control: Manually managing user roles and permissions within the application is error-prone and difficult to scale. Integrating with Active Directory enables centralized role-based access control. - Security Risks: Storing user information solely within the application can pose security risks. Leveraging Active Directory's robust security features enhances the overall security posture.",

      "modern_approaches": "- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC): Utilize these industry-standard protocols for secure authentication and user information exchange with Active Directory. - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) with TLS/SSL: Employ secure communication channels for interacting with Active Directory. - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Implement fine-grained access control based on user attributes retrieved from Active Directory. - Zero Trust Security Model: Adhere to the principles of Zero Trust by verifying user identities and authorizations for every request. - Privacy by Design: Ensure user data privacy by only retrieving and storing necessary information and complying with relevant regulations."
