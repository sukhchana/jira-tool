        Technical Context:
        Technical Domains:
- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:**
- **Best Practices:**
- Use HTTPS for all communication.
- Implement secure token storage and management.
- Utilize Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for public clients.
- Follow the principle of least privilege when requesting scopes.
- Implement token revocation mechanisms.
- **Libraries:**
- **Authlib:** A comprehensive Python library for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
- **Requests-OAuthlib:** A library built on top of the popular Requests library, providing OAuth 2.0 support.
- **Active Directory Integration:**
- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):** A common protocol for accessing and managing directory services like Active Directory.
- **Python Libraries:**
- **ldap3:** A pure Python LDAP library.
- **python-ldap:** A Python wrapper for the OpenLDAP C library.
- **PingFederate Integration:**
- **PingFederate APIs:** Utilize PingFederate's APIs for OAuth 2.0 token issuance and validation.
- **Documentation:** Refer to PingFederate's documentation for integration guides and best practices.
- **Security:**
- **Secure Credential Management:** Securely store and manage client secrets and other sensitive credentials.
- **Token Security:** Implement secure storage, transmission, and validation of OAuth 2.0 tokens.
- **Input Validation:** Prevent injection attacks through rigorous input validation.
- **Python Development:**
- **Frameworks:** Utilize appropriate Python web frameworks like Flask or Django if the project involves a web application.
- **Best Practices:** Follow Python coding best practices for security, readability, and maintainability.

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication:** Implement OAuth 2.0 for both machine-to-machine (M2M) and human-to-machine (H2M) interactions.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the enterprise Active Directory to leverage existing user identities for H2M authentication.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Implementation:** Utilize OIDC for user identity federation and attribute mapping from Active Directory.
- **Python-based Solution:** Implement the solution using suitable Python libraries and frameworks.

        First, provide an implementation strategy:
        <strategy>
        Total Technical Tasks: [number]
        Key Technical Components: [list]
        Implementation Approach: [brief explanation]
        Research Findings: [key technical insights from search]
        Recommended Tools/Frameworks: [based on current best practices]
        </strategy>

        Then, for each user story, create the necessary technical tasks. 
        CRITICAL: Each technical task MUST be wrapped in XML tags exactly like this example:

        <technical_task>
        **Task:** Technical Task - Set up OAuth2 Authentication
        **Description:** Implement OAuth2 authentication flow using the latest security standards.

        Implementation Details:
        1. Set up OAuth2 client configuration:
        {code:python}
        oauth_config = {
            "client_id": os.getenv("OAUTH_CLIENT_ID"),
            "client_secret": os.getenv("OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET"),
            "redirect_uri": "https://your-app/callback",
            "scope": ["openid", "profile", "email"]
        }
        {code}

        2. Implement authorization code flow with PKCE:
        {code:python}
        from authlib.integrations.requests_client import OAuth2Session
        import hashlib
        import base64
        import secrets

        def generate_pkce_pair():
            code_verifier = secrets.token_urlsafe(64)
            code_challenge = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(
                hashlib.sha256(code_verifier.encode()).digest()
            ).decode().rstrip('=')
            return code_verifier, code_challenge
        {code}

        3. Key implementation steps:
        - Store tokens securely in encrypted session
        - Implement token refresh mechanism
        - Add error handling for auth failures
        - Set up proper CORS for OAuth redirects

        **Technical Domain:** Authentication & Security
        **Complexity:** Medium
        **Dependencies:** User Story - Secure Login
        **Implementation Notes:** Use industry-standard OAuth2 libraries
        **Modern Practices:** Implement PKCE, use secure token storage
        **Security Considerations:** Follow OWASP guidelines for OAuth2
        </technical_task>

        FORMATTING RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY:
        1. Start each task with <technical_task> on its own line
        2. End each task with </technical_task> on its own line

           - Start with double asterisks and end with colon (e.g., **Task:**)
           - Be on its own line
           - Have a space after the colon
        4. Description field should include:
           - Clear overview of what needs to be done
           - Implementation details with numbered steps
           - Code snippets where applicable, wrapped in {code:language} tags
           - Configuration examples if needed
           - Key implementation steps and considerations
        5. Fields must appear in this exact order:
           - Task

### Raw Response
```
<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 7
**Key Technical Components:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, Active Directory, RBAC, API Development, UI Development, Python
**Implementation Approach:** Integrate OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication using existing enterprise credentials. Implement RBAC for granular user access control. Develop APIs for user management and resource access. Design UI for user profile management.
**Research Findings:** OAuth 2.0 with PKCE is crucial for secure authentication. OpenID Connect enables user identity federation. Python libraries like Authlib and ldap3 simplify implementation.
**Recommended Tools/Frameworks:** Authlib for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, ldap3 for Active Directory interaction, Flask/Django for web framework (if applicable)
</strategy>
