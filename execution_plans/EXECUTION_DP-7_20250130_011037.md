**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:** Employees requiring access to the application.
* **System Administrators:** Responsible for managing user access and system integration.
* **Security Team:** Ensures the authentication solution meets security standards.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the authentication solution.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) for secure authentication and authorization.
2. **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the Enterprise Active Directory using a protocol like OpenID Connect (OIDC) to leverage existing user identities.
3. **User Attribute Mapping:** Define clear mapping between Active Directory attributes (e.g., sAMAccountName, email) and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
4. **Python Library Integration:** Identify and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support (e.g., requests-oauthlib, python-openid-connect).

**Technical Domains:**

2. **Python Application Setup:** Install required Python libraries (requests-oauthlib, python-openid-connect), configure application settings for OAuth 2.0, and establish communication with PingFederate.

**Phase 2: Authentication and Authorization Flows**

1. **Implement OAuth 2.0 Flows:** Implement the Authorization Code Grant flow for user authentication and the Client Credentials Grant flow for machine-to-machine communication.
2. **Handle and Validate Tokens:** Securely store and validate OAuth 2.0 tokens (access token, refresh token) within the application.
3. **Map User Attributes:** Map relevant Active Directory user attributes to application-specific user information.

**Phase 3: Access Control and Security**

1. **Enforce Access Control:** Implement logic to enforce access control based on user roles derived from Active Directory group memberships.
2. **Secure Communication:** Ensure secure communication between the application, PingFederate, and Active Directory using TLS.

**Phase 4: Testing and Deployment**

1. **Thorough Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing of the authentication and authorization flows, including unit tests, integration tests, and security testing.
2. **Deployment:** Deploy the application to the target environment and configure it to interact with the production instances of PingFederate and Active Directory.

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the Enterprise Active Directory using a protocol like OpenID Connect (OIDC) to leverage existing user identities.
- **User Attribute Mapping:** Define clear mapping between Active Directory attributes (e.g., sAMAccountName, email) and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
- **Python Library Integration:** Identify and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect support (e.g., requests-oauthlib, python-openid-connect).

        First, provide an implementation strategy:
        <strategy>
        Total Technical Tasks: [number]
        Key Technical Components: [list]

        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
        - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces

### Raw Response
```
## Implementation Strategy:

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 10
**Key Technical Components:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, PingFederate, Active Directory, Python, requests-oauthlib, Flask
**Implementation Approach:** 

This strategy outlines a phased approach to implement secure authentication and authorization in the Python application using Active Directory and PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 provider.

**Phase 1: Configuration and Setup**

1. **Configure PingFederate:** Establish PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 authorization server and configure it to connect with the Active Directory. Define the necessary scopes and claims for the application.
2. **Python Application Setup:** Install required Python libraries (requests-oauthlib, python-openid-connect), configure application settings for OAuth 2.0, and establish communication with PingFederate.

**Phase 2: Authentication and Authorization Flows**

1. **Implement OAuth 2.0 Flows:** Implement the Authorization Code Grant flow for user authentication and the Client Credentials Grant flow for machine-to-machine communication.
2. **Handle and Validate Tokens:** Securely store and validate OAuth 2.0 tokens (access token, refresh token) within the application.
3. **Map User Attributes:** Map relevant Active Directory user attributes to application-specific user information.

**Phase 3: Access Control and Security**

1. **Enforce Access Control:** Implement logic to enforce access control based on user roles derived from Active Directory group memberships.
2. **Secure Communication:** Ensure secure communication between the application, PingFederate, and Active Directory using TLS.

**Phase 4: Testing and Deployment**

1. **Thorough Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing of the authentication and authorization flows, including unit tests, integration tests, and security testing.
2. **Deployment:** Deploy the application to the target environment and configure it to interact with the production instances of PingFederate and Active Directory.
</strategy>
