        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

## Implementation Strategy:

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 12
**Key Technical Components:**
* OAuth 2.0 and OIDC Implementation
* PingFederate Configuration
* Active Directory Integration
* Python Backend Development
* Frontend Integration (if applicable)
* Security and Error Handling
* Testing and Deployment

**Implementation Approach:**
This implementation will follow an iterative approach, starting with the core authentication flow and gradually adding features and functionalities. We'll begin by configuring PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider, then implement the Authorization Code Grant flow for user authentication. Next, we'll integrate Active Directory for user authorization and attribute retrieval. Finally, we'll implement the Client Credentials Grant flow for machine-to-machine authentication and add necessary security and error handling mechanisms.
