        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

- **Security:** Secure configuration, token management, best practices for handling sensitive data.

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code or Client Credentials grant types) for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the Enterprise Active Directory to authenticate users and potentially retrieve user attributes.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Support:** Utilize OIDC for user authentication and attribute exchange with Active Directory, defining field mapping for user identification.
- **Python Library Selection:** Choose and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and Active Directory interaction.
- **PING Federate Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate with the existing PING Federate OAuth 2.0 server.

        3. Each field MUST be on a new line
        4. Fields MUST appear in the exact order shown above
        5. All fields are required

        Requirements:
        - Each user story should have 1-2 technical tasks
        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
        - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
        
```
