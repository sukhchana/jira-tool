        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

A significant decrease indicates improved security. - Improved task completion time: Monitor the time taken by users to complete role-specific tasks. A decrease suggests enhanced usability and efficiency. - User satisfaction with access control: Conduct surveys or gather feedback on the clarity and ease of access to application features. Positive feedback indicates successful implementation. - Decrease in support requests related to access issues: Monitor the number of helpdesk tickets or support requests related to access permissions. A reduction signifies improved user experience and reduced support burden.",
