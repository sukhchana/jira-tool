  "changes_requested": "Ensure LEAST Privilege is respected.",
  "changes_interpreted": "<interpretation>\nThe user requests the implementation of the Least Privilege principle in the API endpoint for resource access. This means ensuring that users and applications are granted only the minimum necessary permissions to access the resources they need, and nothing more.\n\n**Requested Changes:**\n\n1. **Implement fine-grained access control:** The current implementation only checks for a valid token. It needs to be enhanced to verify if the user/application associated with the token has the necessary permissions to access the *specific* resource and perform the requested action (read, write, etc.).\n\n**Impact Analysis:**\n\n- **Fields to Modify:**\n    - `implementation_details.technical_approach`: Update to include details about permission checks.\n    - `implementation_details.code_blocks`: Modify the code to incorporate permission validation logic.\n    - `security_considerations`:  Emphasize the importance of Least Privilege and how it's addressed.\n- **Dependencies Affected:** Potentially yes. \n    -  If `TECHNICAL-TASK-1` involves defining user roles and permissions, then this task becomes dependent on its completion.\n- **Related Tickets Impact:**  Potentially yes. \n    -  Any tickets related to defining user roles, permissions, or resource access control will be impacted and need to be aligned with this change.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1. **Define Access Control Model:**\n    - Determine the granularity of access control (e.g., role-based, attribute-based, policy-based).\n    - Define roles, permissions, or attributes relevant to the protected resources.\n2. **Update Token Validation Logic:**\n    - After token validation, extract user roles, permissions, or attributes from the token claims.\n3. **Implement Permission Checks:**\n    - Before granting access to the resource, verify if the user/application possesses the required permissions for the specific action being requested.\n4. **Handle Authorization Errors:**\n    - Implement appropriate error handling for unauthorized access attempts (e.g., return 403 Forbidden).\n5. **Update Documentation:**\n    - Document the implemented access control model and how it's enforced by the API endpoint.\n6. **Testing:**\n    - Thoroughly test the implementation to ensure that Least Privilege is correctly enforced. \n</interpretation> \n",
