3. **Admin Interface:** Develop an administrative interface to allow authorized personnel to view and manage synchronized user attributes.
4. **Data Synchronization:** Implement mechanisms to handle updates or changes to user attributes in Active Directory and synchronize them with the application.

**Technical Domain:** User Management
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Technical Task - Implement User Authentication with Active Directory
**Implementation Notes:** Use Python LDAP libraries for attribute retrieval and consider implementing a caching mechanism for performance optimization.
**Modern Practices:** Implement a robust audit trail to track changes made to user attributes.
**Security Considerations:** Enforce proper authorization checks to restrict attribute management to authorized personnel only.

<technical_task>
**Task:** Technical Task - Secure API Endpoints with OAuth 2.0
**Description:** 
Protect API endpoints by enforcing OAuth 2.0 access token validation.

Implementation Details:
1. **Token Verification:** Implement a middleware or interceptor to verify the validity and scope of access tokens included in API requests.
2. **Authorization Enforcement:** Based on the token's scope and user information, enforce authorization rules to determine access permissions to specific API endpoints or resources.
3. **Error Handling:** Handle invalid, expired, or insufficient scope tokens with appropriate HTTP error responses (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden).

**Technical Domain:** API Security
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Technical Task - Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Flow
**Implementation Notes:** Utilize JWT libraries for token decoding and validation.
**Modern Practices:** Implement token revocation mechanisms to invalidate tokens when necessary.
**Security Considerations:** Protect the communication channel between the application and the authorization server using HTTPS.
</technical_task>

<technical_task>
**Task:** Technical Task - Implement Frontend Login and User Attribute Display
**Description:** 
Develop the frontend components for user login using Active Directory credentials and display user attributes.

Implementation Details:
1. **Login Form:** Create a login form that securely collects user credentials (username and password).
2. **Authentication Request:** Upon form submission, initiate an authentication request to the backend, which handles the OAuth 2.0 flow and Active Directory communication.
3. **User Profile:** Upon successful login, display relevant user attributes retrieved from Active Directory in a user profile section.
4. **Error Handling:** Display user-friendly error messages for incorrect credentials or other authentication issues.

**Technical Domain:** Frontend Development
**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Technical Task - Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Flow, Technical Task - Retrieve and Manage User Attributes from Active Directory
**Implementation Notes:** Use a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for building interactive user interfaces.
**Modern Practices:** Implement a secure password reset mechanism.
**Security Considerations:** Prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by sanitizing user inputs and use HTTPS to secure communication between the frontend and backend.
