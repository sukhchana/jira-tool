        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

- Active Directory Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the existing Active Directory and retrieve user information.
- PingFederate Integration:** Configure PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider, leveraging its existing integration with the enterprise Active Directory.
Technical Domains: - Authentication and Authorization:**
- Best Practices:** Implement industry-standard OAuth 2.0 flows and security measures. Utilize OpenID Connect for user authentication and attribute retrieval.
- Technologies:** Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-client` can be used.
- Active Directory Integration:**
- Best Practices:** Securely connect to and query Active Directory using LDAP or other appropriate protocols. Map Active Directory attributes to application roles and permissions.
- Technologies:** Python libraries like `ldap3` can be used for Active Directory interaction.
- PingFederate Integration:**
- Best Practices:**  Follow PingFederate's best practices for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect configuration. Utilize PingFederate SDKs and APIs for seamless integration.
- Technologies:** PingFederate provides documentation and SDKs for Python integration.
Dependencies: - Enterprise Active Directory:** The application relies on the existing Active Directory for user information and authentication.
- PingFederate Server:** The project depends on the availability and proper configuration of the PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect functionality.
Challenges: - Securely Handling User Data:** Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive user information during authentication and data retrieval is crucial.
- Mapping Active Directory Attributes:**  Accurately mapping Active Directory attributes to application-specific roles and permissions requires careful planning and coordination.
- User Experience:** Designing a seamless and user-friendly authentication flow is essential for user adoption and satisfaction.

      "pain_points": "- **Manual Integration:** Currently, integrating internal systems likely requires manual processes, leading to inefficiencies and potential for errors. - **Security Risks:** Lack of a standardized, secure authentication mechanism for applications increases the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. - **Limited Automation:** Inability to automate inter-system communication hinders operational efficiency and scalability.",
      "success_metrics": "- **Reduction in Manual Integration Time:** Measure the time saved in integrating new applications or processes after implementing this story. - **Increase in Automated Tasks:** Track the number of tasks successfully automated through machine-to-machine communication. - **Number of Successful Authentications:** Monitor the successful authentication attempts by machine clients, indicating proper implementation and adoption. - **Zero Security Breaches Related to Machine Clients:** A critical metric demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented security measures.",
      "similar_implementations": "- **Google Cloud Platform Service Accounts:** Provides machine-to-machine authentication for applications interacting with Google Cloud services (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) - **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles for Applications:** Enables assigning permissions to applications to access AWS resources (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_usecases.html#roles-to-delegate-permissions) - **Auth0 Machine-to-Machine:** Offers OAuth 2.0 flows specifically designed for securing machine-to-machine communication (https://auth0.com/docs/flows/machine-to-machine)",
      "modern_approaches": "- **Zero Trust Security:** Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring machine clients only have access to the resources absolutely necessary. - **Short-Lived Access Tokens:** Issue tokens with short expiration times to minimize the impact of compromised credentials. - **Token Revocation Mechanisms:** Establish a robust system for revoking access tokens when necessary, such as in case of suspected security breaches. - **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:** Implement centralized logging and monitoring of machine client activity to detect and respond to suspicious behavior effectively."
