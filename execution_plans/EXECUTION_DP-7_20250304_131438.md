        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

    <research_findings>
        - Python has excellent libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (e.g., `Authlib`, `requests-oauthlib`).
        - Ping Federate is a well-established enterprise-grade OAuth 2.0 server.  Integration strategies and documentation are readily available.
        - Active Directory integration often involves LDAP or Microsoft Graph API, depending on the desired level of control and features.
        - Security best practices for OAuth 2.0 are crucial, including proper token handling, PKCE, and protection against common attacks.
        - OpenID Connect is the preferred protocol for identity management on top of OAuth 2.0, providing user information.
    </research_findings>

<analysis>
    <main_objective>
        Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and integrate it with the existing Enterprise Active Directory using Ping Federate, supporting both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication, while leveraging OpenID Connect for user identity information.
    </main_objective>

    <stakeholders>
        - Application Users (both human and machine)
        - Security Team
        - IT Operations/Infrastructure Team (responsible for Active Directory and Ping Federate)
        - Development Team
        - Product Owner/Manager
    </stakeholders>

    <core_requirements>
        - Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine scenarios.
        - Integrate with the existing Enterprise Active Directory to source user details.
        - Utilize OpenID Connect to retrieve user information (user ID, etc.) from Active Directory via Ping Federate.
        - Develop a Python-based solution that interacts with Ping Federate for authentication and authorization.
    </core_requirements>

    <technical_domains>
        - **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Best practices include using a well-vetted library like `Authlib` or `requests-oauthlib` in Python.  Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients (e.g., mobile apps or single-page applications).  Properly handle refresh tokens and access tokens.  Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for access tokens.
        - **OpenID Connect (OIDC):**  OIDC builds on OAuth 2.0 and provides a standardized way to retrieve user profile information.  Use a library that supports OIDC discovery to automatically configure the client.  Carefully map the claims returned by Ping Federate to the application's user model.
        - **Active Directory Integration:**  Determine the best method for accessing Active Directory information via Ping Federate.  This might involve configuring Ping Federate to act as an OIDC provider that sources user data from AD.  Alternatively, if direct access to AD is required (less likely with Ping Federate in place), consider using `python-ldap` or the Microsoft Graph API (if AD is synchronized with Azure AD).
        - **Ping Federate Integration:**  Thoroughly understand the Ping Federate configuration and capabilities.  Work with the IT Operations team to configure Ping Federate as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and OIDC provider.  Obtain the necessary client credentials and endpoints.  Leverage Ping Federate's documentation and support resources.
    </technical_domains>

    <dependencies>
        - Availability and configuration of the Enterprise Ping Federate server.
        - Access to Active Directory (either directly or via Ping Federate).
        - Agreement on the specific user attributes to be retrieved from Active Directory and their corresponding claims in the OIDC response.
    </dependencies>

    <challenges>
        - **Complexity of OAuth 2.0 Flows:**  Understanding and implementing the correct OAuth 2.0 flow for different client types (e.g., authorization code flow with PKCE for web apps, client credentials flow for machine-to-machine).
        - **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Properly securing the OAuth 2.0 implementation to prevent common attacks such as token theft, replay attacks, and authorization code interception.
        - **Mapping Active Directory Attributes to Claims:**  Ensuring accurate and consistent mapping of user attributes from Active Directory to the claims returned in the OIDC response.
        - **Performance and Scalability:**  Designing the authentication system to handle a large number of users and requests without impacting performance.
        - **Error Handling and Logging:**  Implementing robust error handling and logging to facilitate debugging and troubleshooting.
    </challenges>

    <industry_context>
        - **Industry Standards:** OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749), OpenID Connect (OIDC), JWT (RFC 7519).
        - **Best Practices:** Use established OAuth 2.0 and OIDC libraries. Implement PKCE for public clients.  Validate access tokens.  Use HTTPS for all communication.  Regularly review and update security configurations.
        - **Compliance Requirements:** Depending on the industry and application, compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS may apply.  Ensure that the authentication system meets these requirements.  Consider data residency requirements.

## User Story Generation - User Story - Implement OAuth 2.0 Client for Machine-to-Machine Authentication

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and integrate it with the existing Enterprise Active Directory using Ping Federate, supporting both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication, while leveraging OpenID Connect for user identity information.
Technical Domains:
- OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Best practices include using a well-vetted library like `Authlib` or `requests-oauthlib` in Python.  Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients (e.g., mobile apps or single-page applications).  Properly handle refresh tokens and access tokens.  Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for access tokens.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC):**  OIDC builds on OAuth 2.0 and provides a standardized way to retrieve user profile information.  Use a library that supports OIDC discovery to automatically configure the client.  Carefully map the claims returned by Ping Federate to the application's user model.
- Active Directory Integration:**  Determine the best method for accessing Active Directory information via Ping Federate.  This might involve configuring Ping Federate to act as an OIDC provider that sources user data from AD.  Alternatively, if direct access to AD is required (less likely with Ping Federate in place), consider using `python-ldap` or the Microsoft Graph API (if AD is synchronized with Azure AD).
- Ping Federate Integration:**  Thoroughly understand the Ping Federate configuration and capabilities.  Work with the IT Operations team to configure Ping Federate as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and OIDC provider.  Obtain the necessary client credentials and endpoints.  Leverage Ping Federate's documentation and support resources.
Core Requirements:
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine scenarios.
- Integrate with the existing Enterprise Active Directory to source user details.
- Utilize OpenID Connect to retrieve user information (user ID, etc.) from Active Directory via Ping Federate.
- Develop a Python-based solution that interacts with Ping Federate for authentication and authorization.
Stakeholders:
- Application Users (both human and machine)
- Security Team
- IT Operations/Infrastructure Team (responsible for Active Directory and Ping Federate)
- Development Team
- Product Owner/Manager

## User Story Generation - User Story - Implement OAuth 2.0 Client for Human-to-Machine Authentication with OIDC

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and integrate it with the existing Enterprise Active Directory using Ping Federate, supporting both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication, while leveraging OpenID Connect for user identity information.
Technical Domains:
- OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Best practices include using a well-vetted library like `Authlib` or `requests-oauthlib` in Python.  Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients (e.g., mobile apps or single-page applications).  Properly handle refresh tokens and access tokens.  Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for access tokens.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC):**  OIDC builds on OAuth 2.0 and provides a standardized way to retrieve user profile information.  Use a library that supports OIDC discovery to automatically configure the client.  Carefully map the claims returned by Ping Federate to the application's user model.
- Active Directory Integration:**  Determine the best method for accessing Active Directory information via Ping Federate.  This might involve configuring Ping Federate to act as an OIDC provider that sources user data from AD.  Alternatively, if direct access to AD is required (less likely with Ping Federate in place), consider using `python-ldap` or the Microsoft Graph API (if AD is synchronized with Azure AD).
- Ping Federate Integration:**  Thoroughly understand the Ping Federate configuration and capabilities.  Work with the IT Operations team to configure Ping Federate as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and OIDC provider.  Obtain the necessary client credentials and endpoints.  Leverage Ping Federate's documentation and support resources.
Core Requirements:
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine scenarios.
- Integrate with the existing Enterprise Active Directory to source user details.
- Utilize OpenID Connect to retrieve user information (user ID, etc.) from Active Directory via Ping Federate.
- Develop a Python-based solution that interacts with Ping Federate for authentication and authorization.
Stakeholders:
- Application Users (both human and machine)
- Security Team
- IT Operations/Infrastructure Team (responsible for Active Directory and Ping Federate)
- Development Team
- Product Owner/Manager

## User Story Generation - User Story - Securely Store and Manage OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and integrate it with the existing Enterprise Active Directory using Ping Federate, supporting both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication, while leveraging OpenID Connect for user identity information.
Technical Domains:
- OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Best practices include using a well-vetted library like `Authlib` or `requests-oauthlib` in Python.  Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for public clients (e.g., mobile apps or single-page applications).  Properly handle refresh tokens and access tokens.  Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for access tokens.
- OpenID Connect (OIDC):**  OIDC builds on OAuth 2.0 and provides a standardized way to retrieve user profile information.  Use a library that supports OIDC discovery to automatically configure the client.  Carefully map the claims returned by Ping Federate to the application's user model.
- Active Directory Integration:**  Determine the best method for accessing Active Directory information via Ping Federate.  This might involve configuring Ping Federate to act as an OIDC provider that sources user data from AD.  Alternatively, if direct access to AD is required (less likely with Ping Federate in place), consider using `python-ldap` or the Microsoft Graph API (if AD is synchronized with Azure AD).
- Ping Federate Integration:**  Thoroughly understand the Ping Federate configuration and capabilities.  Work with the IT Operations team to configure Ping Federate as an OAuth 2.0 authorization server and OIDC provider.  Obtain the necessary client credentials and endpoints.  Leverage Ping Federate's documentation and support resources.
Core Requirements:
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine scenarios.
- Integrate with the existing Enterprise Active Directory to source user details.
- Utilize OpenID Connect to retrieve user information (user ID, etc.) from Active Directory via Ping Federate.
- Develop a Python-based solution that interacts with Ping Federate for authentication and authorization.
Stakeholders:
- Application Users (both human and machine)
- Security Team
- IT Operations/Infrastructure Team (responsible for Active Directory and Ping Federate)
- Development Team
- Product Owner/Manager

        REQUIRED FORMAT - Each user story in the array must have these exact fields:

            }
        }

        Guidelines:
        1. Each story should be focused on a single user goal
        2. Include clear acceptance criteria
        3. Specify required skills based on technical implementation needs
        4. Suggest assignee based on the primary technical domain and skills
