        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

</summary>

<analysis>

**Main Objective:** 

Enable secure authentication and authorization for the Python application by implementing OAuth 2.0, leveraging the existing enterprise OAuth 2 server (Ping Federate) and integrating with the Enterprise Active Directory for user identity management.

**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:**  Those who will authenticate with the system.
* **Application Developers:** Responsible for implementing the authentication solution.
* **Security Team:**  Oversees security policies and standards.
* **IT Operations:** Manages the Active Directory and Ping Federate infrastructure.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens for protected resources.
2. **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with Active Directory to leverage existing user identities and attributes for authentication and authorization.
3. **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect to obtain user profile information from Active Directory after successful authentication. Define a mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID).
4. **Ping Federate Integration:** Configure Ping Federate as the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider, connecting it to the Active Directory for user authentication and authorization.

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2. **Identity Management:** Active Directory, LDAP, User attributes and roles.
3. **Python Development:** Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and Active Directory interaction (e.g., requests-oauthlib, python-openid-connect, python-ldap).
4. **API Security:** Secure communication with APIs using access tokens, potentially implementing scopes and claims for fine-grained authorization.

**Dependencies:**

1. **Enterprise Active Directory:**  Availability and accessibility of the Active Directory for user information retrieval.
2. **Ping Federate:**  Proper configuration and availability of the Ping Federate server for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect services.

**Challenges:**

1. **Complexity of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Implementing these protocols correctly and securely can be challenging, requiring a thorough understanding of the specifications and best practices.
2. **Active Directory Integration:**  Seamless integration with Active Directory, including user attribute mapping and potential performance considerations, might require specific expertise.
3. **Python Library Selection and Integration:** Choosing the right Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and Active Directory interaction, and integrating them effectively into the existing codebase, could pose challenges.

        Technical Context:
        Technical Domains:
- **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Identity Management:** Active Directory, LDAP, User attributes and roles.
- **Python Development:** Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and Active Directory interaction (e.g., requests-oauthlib, python-openid-connect, python-ldap).
- **API Security:** Secure communication with APIs using access tokens, potentially implementing scopes and claims for fine-grained authorization.

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens for protected resources.
- **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with Active Directory to leverage existing user identities and attributes for authentication and authorization.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect to obtain user profile information from Active Directory after successful authentication. Define a mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID).
- **Ping Federate Integration:** Configure Ping Federate as the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider, connecting it to the Active Directory for user authentication and authorization.

        First, provide an implementation strategy:

        Requirements:
        - Each user story should have 1-2 technical tasks
        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
