        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

Total Technical Domains: 5
Total Core Requirements: 4
Total Dependencies: 1
Total Challenges: 3
Research Findings: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are widely used for authentication and authorization. Integration with Active Directory is a common requirement. Secure implementation is crucial, involving HTTPS, token management, and adherence to best practices. Python offers libraries like oauthlib and requests for OAuth 2.0 integration. Case studies highlight successful implementations in various domains.
</summary>

<analysis>
Main Objective: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine (M2M) and human-to-machine (H2M) interactions, integrating with an existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server and Enterprise Active Directory for user identity management.

Stakeholders:

* System Users (Human and Machine)
* System Administrators
* Security Team
* Development Team

Core Requirements:

1.  Support OAuth 2.0 for M2M and H2M authentication.
2.  Integrate with existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server.
3.  Utilize Active Directory for user identity information.
4.  Implement secure token handling and storage.

Technical Domains:

1.  **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Utilize a Python library like "oauthlib" or "requests-oauthlib" to handle OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code or Client Credentials grant for M2M).
2.  **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:** Leverage OIDC for user authentication and attribute retrieval from Active Directory. OIDC is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and simplifies user identity management.
3.  **Active Directory Communication:** Use LDAP or secure LDAPS to query Active Directory for user details based on attributes returned by the OIDC provider (PingFederate).
4.  **Security Best Practices:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Securely store client secrets and tokens.
    *   Implement token refresh mechanisms.
    *   Validate tokens and enforce scope limitations.
    *   Consider PKCE for mobile or single-page applications.
5.  **Python Development:**
    *   Utilize Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and LDAP communication.
    *   Implement secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.
    *   Thoroughly test and document the authentication flow.

Dependencies:

* Existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server and its configuration.

Challenges:

1.  **Seamless User Experience:** Ensure a smooth authentication process for users, minimizing friction and potential confusion.
2.  **Security Considerations:** Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
3.  **Error Handling and Recovery:** Develop comprehensive error handling mechanisms to address potential issues during authentication and authorization.

Industry Context:

*   OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol for authorization.
*   OpenID Connect is widely adopted for user authentication and single sign-on (SSO).
*   Integrating with Active Directory is common in enterprise environments.
*   Security best practices and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) must be considered.
