        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

2. **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with Active Directory to leverage existing user identities and group memberships for authorization.
3. **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:** Utilize OIDC for user authentication and attribute retrieval from Active Directory.
4. **User Attribute Mapping:** Define clear mapping between Active Directory attributes (e.g., userPrincipalName) and application-specific user identifiers.
5. **PingFederate Integration:** Configure PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider, ensuring seamless communication and token exchange.

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2. **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP.
3. **Python Development:** Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and LDAP interaction.
4. **Identity Provider Integration:** PingFederate configuration and API interaction.

**Dependencies:**

1. **Enterprise Active Directory:** Availability and accessibility of the Active Directory for user data retrieval.
2. **PingFederate:**  Availability and proper configuration of the PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC services.

**Challenges:**

1. **Complexity of OAuth 2.0 and OIDC:** Implementing and configuring these protocols correctly can be challenging, requiring a thorough understanding of the specifications and security considerations.
2. **Active Directory Integration:**  Ensuring efficient and secure communication with Active Directory, potentially handling large user populations and complex group structures.
3. **Python Library Selection:** Choosing appropriate and well-maintained Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and LDAP integration, considering factors like security, performance, and community support.
