        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

    <research_findings>OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard for authorization. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is built on top of OAuth 2.0 and provides identity information. Python has robust libraries like `Authlib`, `requests-oauthlib`, and `Flask-OIDC` for implementing OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. Integrating with Active Directory requires understanding its schema and using appropriate libraries (e.g., `python-ldap`). Ping Federate is a common enterprise OAuth 2.0 provider, and its specific configuration and APIs will be crucial.  Security best practices, including token storage and validation, are paramount.  Consider using a dedicated secrets management solution.  Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.</research_findings>

<analysis>
    <main_objective>
        Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions, integrating with the existing Enterprise Active Directory via OpenID Connect and leveraging the existing Ping Federate OAuth 2.0 server, within a Python-based project.
    </main_objective>

    <stakeholders>
        - Application Users (both human and machine)
        - IT Security Team
        - Application Development Team
        - Active Directory Administrators
        - Ping Federate Administrators
    </stakeholders>

    <core_requirements>
        - Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for machine-to-machine interactions.
        - Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for human-to-machine interactions, leveraging existing Active Directory identities.
        - Integrate with the existing Ping Federate OAuth 2.0 server.
        - Define and document the mapping between Active Directory attributes and application user fields (e.g., user ID).
    </core_requirements>

    <technical_domains>
        - **OAuth 2.0 Implementation (with Python):** Best practices include using a well-maintained library like `Authlib` or `requests-oauthlib`.  Implement proper token storage (e.g., using a secure database or session management) and validation.  Follow the principle of least privilege when requesting scopes.  Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security.
        - **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:** Best practices include using a dedicated OIDC library (e.g., `Flask-OIDC` for Flask applications).  Validate the ID token signature and claims.  Use the `nonce` parameter to prevent replay attacks.  Properly handle user session management after successful authentication.
        - **Active Directory Integration (with Python):** Best practices include using the `python-ldap` library.  Securely store the Active Directory credentials used for querying.  Implement proper error handling and logging.  Optimize queries to minimize the impact on Active Directory performance.  Consider using a caching mechanism to reduce the number of Active Directory queries.
        - **Ping Federate Configuration:** Best practices include understanding Ping Federate's configuration options for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC.  Properly configure client applications in Ping Federate.  Define appropriate scopes and claims.  Ensure that Ping Federate is configured to trust the application.  Monitor Ping Federate logs for errors and security events.
    </technical_domains>

    <dependencies>
        - Access to and configuration details of the Enterprise Ping Federate OAuth 2.0 server.
        - Access to and credentials for querying the Enterprise Active Directory.
        - Agreement on the mapping between Active Directory attributes and application user fields.
    </dependencies>

    <challenges>
        - **Complexity of OAuth 2.0 Flows:** Understanding and implementing the different OAuth 2.0 flows (e.g., authorization code grant, client credentials grant) can be complex.
        - **Security Considerations:** OAuth 2.0 and OIDC introduce security risks if not implemented correctly.  Proper token storage, validation, and handling are crucial.
        - **Active Directory Schema and Permissions:** Understanding the Active Directory schema and obtaining the necessary permissions to query user information can be challenging.
        - **Ping Federate Configuration:** Configuring Ping Federate to properly support the application's OAuth 2.0 and OIDC requirements can be complex.  Requires coordination with the Ping Federate administrators.
        - **Performance Impact:** Querying Active Directory for user information can impact performance.  Optimizing queries and using caching mechanisms are important.
    </challenges>

    <industry_context>
        - **Industry Standards:** OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749), OpenID Connect (OIDC)
        - **Best Practices:** OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet, NIST Special Publication 800-63 (Digital Identity Guidelines)
        - **Compliance Requirements:** Depending on the industry and application, compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS may apply.  These requirements may impact the implementation of authentication and authorization.  For example, GDPR requires that user data be protected and that users have the right to access and delete their data.
