        Technical Context:
        Technical Domains:
- **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP
- **Identity Provider Integration:** PingFederate APIs and configuration
- **Python Development:** Relevant Python libraries (e.g., Flask-OAuth, python-jose, requests)

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) for authentication and authorization.
- **Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize Active Directory as the identity source for user authentication.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration:** Leverage OIDC for user identity information retrieval and define field mapping between OIDC claims and application user attributes.
- **PingFederate Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate with the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server.
- **Python Support:**  Utilize Python libraries and frameworks to implement the solution.

        First, provide an implementation strategy:
        <strategy>
        Total Technical Tasks: [number]
        Key Technical Components: [list]
        Implementation Approach: [brief explanation]
        </strategy>

        Then, for each user story, create the necessary technical tasks using EXACTLY this format:

        2. Each field MUST be prefixed with double asterisks and colon (e.g., **Task:**)
        3. Each field MUST be on a new line
        4. Fields MUST appear in the exact order shown above
        5. All fields are required
        6. Use clear, specific titles for tasks
        7. Separate multiple dependencies with commas

        Requirements:
        - Each user story should have 1-2 technical tasks
        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
        - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
        
```

### Raw Response
```
## Implementation Strategy:

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 10
**Key Technical Components:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, PingFederate, Active Directory, JWT, Python (Flask/Django), python-jose, requests
**Implementation Approach:**

We will utilize a phased approach, starting with core authentication and authorization functionality and then expanding to cover user and machine client scenarios, claim mapping, and security enhancements.

**Phase 1: Core Authentication and Authorization**
- Configure PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC Provider.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant flow for human users.
- Implement JWT validation and decoding for authorization.

**Phase 2: Client Credentials Grant and Claim Mapping**
- Implement OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant flow for machine clients.
- Configure OIDC claim mapping between PingFederate and the application.

**Phase 3: Security and Monitoring**
- Implement robust error handling and security best practices.
- Set up monitoring and auditing for authentication events.
