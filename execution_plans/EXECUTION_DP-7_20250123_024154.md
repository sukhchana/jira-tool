        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etc…

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

Total Challenges: 3
</summary>

<analysis>
**Main Objective:** 

Enable secure authentication for the Python application using OAuth 2.0, leveraging the existing enterprise Active Directory and PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 server. This involves supporting both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication flows.

**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:** Employees requiring access to the application.
* **Security Team:** Responsible for overall security posture and compliance.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the authentication solution.
* **IT Operations:** Responsible for managing Active Directory and PingFederate.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human-to-machine and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) in the Python application.
2. **Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the existing Active Directory, leveraging their existing identities.
3. **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement a mapping between Active Directory user attributes and the application's required user information (e.g., user ID, email).
4. **PingFederate Integration:** Configure PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 authorization server and integrate it with the Python application.

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication & Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
2. **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP.
3. **Identity Provider (IdP):** PingFederate configuration and integration.
4. **Python Development:**  Utilizing relevant Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC integration (e.g., requests-oauthlib, oauthlib).

**Dependencies:**

1. **Existing Enterprise Active Directory:**  The solution relies on the availability and functionality of the existing Active Directory.
2. **PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server:**  The solution depends on the existing PingFederate server and its configuration for OAuth 2.0.

**Challenges:**

1. **Python Library Selection:** Choosing the appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC integration, considering factors like security, ease of use, and community support.
2. **Attribute Mapping Complexity:**  Ensuring accurate and consistent mapping of user attributes between Active Directory and the application.
3. **PingFederate Integration:**  Successfully configuring PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 server and integrating it seamlessly with the Python application.
