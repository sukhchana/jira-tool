* **Security Team:** Responsible for overall security posture and compliance.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the authentication system.
* **IT Operations:** Responsible for managing Active Directory and PingFederate.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) for authentication and authorization.
2. **Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the existing Active Directory, ensuring proper user attribute mapping (e.g., user ID).
3. **PingFederate Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate with the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server for token issuance and validation.
4. **Python Library Selection:** Choose and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect functionality.

**Technical Domains:**

## Implementation Strategy:

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 10
**Key Technical Components:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, PingFederate, Active Directory, Python (requests-oauthlib, oauthlib, python-jose), JWT Validation, Logging, Scopes Configuration

**Implementation Approach:**

This implementation will leverage a phased approach, starting with core authentication and authorization functionality and then expanding to cover advanced features like single sign-out and granular access control.

**Phase 1: Core Authentication and Authorization**

- Integrate PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant and Client Credentials Grant) using Python libraries.
- Configure Active Directory as the user store for authentication via OpenID Connect.
- Validate JWT tokens issued by PingFederate.

**Phase 2: Enhanced Security and Access Control**

- Implement single sign-out functionality using front-channel logout or similar mechanisms.
- Configure detailed authentication logging for both the application and PingFederate.
- Define and implement OAuth 2.0 scopes to enable granular access control based on user roles and permissions.

This strategy ensures a secure and scalable solution that meets the requirements outlined in the user stories.

### Prompt
```

        Please create technical tasks needed to implement these user stories:

        User Stories:
        Story: User Story - Authenticate with Active Directory Credentials
Description: As an **End User**, I want to log in to the application using my existing Active Directory credentials so that I can access my work resources securely without creating a separate account.
Technical Domain: Authentication and Authorization

Story: User Story - Access Application Resources After Authentication
Description: As an **End User**, I want to access application features and data after successful authentication so that I can perform my work tasks efficiently.
Technical Domain: Authentication and Authorization

Story: User Story - Single Sign-Out from Application and PingFederate
Description: As an **End User**, I want to sign out of the application and be automatically signed out of PingFederate so that I can ensure my session is terminated securely across all systems.
Technical Domain: Authentication and Authorization

Story: User Story - Monitor Authentication Logs for Security Auditing
Description: As a **Security Team** member, I want to access detailed authentication logs from the application and PingFederate so that I can monitor for suspicious activity and ensure compliance with security policies.
Technical Domain: Directory Services, Identity Provider (IdP)

Story: User Story - Configure OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Granular Access Control
Description: As a **Development Team** member, I want to define and configure different OAuth 2.0 scopes for the application so that we can control access to specific resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
Technical Domain: Authentication and Authorization


        Technical Context:
        Technical Domains:
- **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP.
- **Identity Provider (IdP):** PingFederate.
- **Python Development:** Relevant libraries (e.g., `requests-oauthlib`, `oauthlib`, `python-jose`).

Core Requirements:
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) for authentication and authorization.
- **Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the existing Active Directory, ensuring proper user attribute mapping (e.g., user ID).
- **PingFederate Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate with the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server for token issuance and validation.
- **Python Library Selection:** Choose and integrate appropriate Python libraries for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect functionality.

        First, provide an implementation strategy:
        <strategy>
        Total Technical Tasks: [number]
        Key Technical Components: [list]
        Implementation Approach: [brief explanation]
        </strategy>

        Then, for each user story, create the necessary technical tasks using EXACTLY this format:

        <technical_task>
        **Task:** Technical Task - [What needs to be built]
        **Description:** [Technical implementation details]
        **Technical Domain:** [Specific technical area]
        **Complexity:** [Low/Medium/High]
        **Dependencies:** [Related user story or other tasks]
        **Implementation Notes:** [Key technical considerations]
        </technical_task>

        Important Formatting Requirements:
        1. Each task MUST be wrapped in <technical_task> tags
        2. Each field MUST be prefixed with double asterisks and colon (e.g., **Task:**)
        3. Each field MUST be on a new line
        4. Fields MUST appear in the exact order shown above
        5. All fields are required
        6. Use clear, specific titles for tasks
        7. Separate multiple dependencies with commas

        Requirements:
        - Each user story should have 1-2 technical tasks
        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
        - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
        
```

### Raw Response
```
## Implementation Strategy:

<strategy>
**Total Technical Tasks:** 10
**Key Technical Components:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, PingFederate, Active Directory, Python (requests-oauthlib, oauthlib, python-jose), JWT Validation, Logging, Scopes Configuration

**Implementation Approach:**

This implementation will leverage a phased approach, starting with core authentication and authorization functionality and then expanding to cover advanced features like single sign-out and granular access control.

**Phase 1: Core Authentication and Authorization**

- Integrate PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider.
- Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant and Client Credentials Grant) using Python libraries.
- Configure Active Directory as the user store for authentication via OpenID Connect.
- Validate JWT tokens issued by PingFederate.

**Phase 2: Enhanced Security and Access Control**

- Implement single sign-out functionality using front-channel logout or similar mechanisms.
- Configure detailed authentication logging for both the application and PingFederate.
- Define and implement OAuth 2.0 scopes to enable granular access control based on user roles and permissions.

This strategy ensures a secure and scalable solution that meets the requirements outlined in the user stories.
</strategy>
