## Architecture Design Generation

### Prompt
```

        You are a senior solutions architect with expertise in cloud architecture design. 
        You need to create a comprehensive architecture design for the following system requirements:
        
        Epic Title: GRID Compute
        
        Epic Description:
        We would like to host a highly scalable, and burst-able grid compute application, which is currently containerised. We would like it to connect and use a Hashicorp Vault, and for it to be hosted on AWS. 

It would require a high-speed file-system, with super low latency that can work. We would like flexibility over our container hosting solution, and the ability to change the underlying node types and so we are thinking EKS on AWS as a possibility. 

Finally we would need some sort of ingress and queue mechanism to source messages for the GRID. 

The GRID has a master pool, and a worker pool, the masters break complex tasks into smaller units that the worker pools consume from.

### Raw Response
```
Okay, here's a comprehensive architecture design for the GRID Compute system on AWS, addressing the requirements for scalability, burstability, high-speed file system, container orchestration flexibility, HashiCorp Vault integration, and message queuing.

**1. Architecture Overview**

The architecture leverages EKS for container orchestration, providing the flexibility to manage container deployments and scale the GRID compute application.  FSx for Lustre is used for the high-performance file system, catering to the low-latency requirements. SQS is used for message queuing, enabling asynchronous communication between the master and worker pools. HashiCorp Vault is integrated for secure secret management.  The architecture is designed for high availability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

*   **Container Orchestration:** EKS is chosen for its flexibility and control over the container environment. This allows for easy scaling, rolling updates, and the ability to change underlying node types as needed.
*   **High-Speed File System:** FSx for Lustre is selected for its low latency and high throughput, essential for the GRID compute application's performance.
*   **Message Queuing:** SQS is used to decouple the master and worker pools, enabling asynchronous processing and improved scalability.
*   **Secret Management:** HashiCorp Vault is integrated to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys.
*   **High Availability:** The architecture is designed to be highly available by deploying resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).  EKS clusters are configured to span multiple AZs, and FSx for Lustre file systems can be configured for replication.
*   **Security:** Security is a primary consideration, with IAM roles and policies used to control access to resources.  Network security groups are used to restrict traffic to specific ports and protocols.  Encryption is used for data at rest and in transit.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** CloudWatch is used for monitoring the health and performance of the system.  CloudTrail is used for auditing API calls.

    subgraph "External Clients"
        Client[Client Application]
    end
    Client --> Route53
```

*Description:* This diagram shows the high-level system architecture. Clients access the application through Route 53, which routes traffic to the Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB distributes traffic to the EKS cluster. The EKS cluster interacts with SQS for message queuing, HashiCorp Vault for secret management, and FSx for Lustre for the high-performance file system.

**b. Sequence Diagram: Task Processing**

    participant SQS Queue
    participant EKS Worker
    participant FSx for Lustre

    Client->>ALB: Sends Task Request
    ALB->>EKS Master: Routes Request
    EKS Master->>SQS Queue: Enqueues Task
    SQS Queue->>EKS Worker: Delivers Task
    EKS Worker->>FSx for Lustre: Reads Input Data
    EKS Worker->>FSx for Lustre: Writes Output Data
    EKS Worker->>SQS Queue: Sends Completion Notification
    SQS Queue-->>EKS Master: Completion Notification
    EKS Master->>ALB: Sends Response
    ALB->>Client: Returns Result
```

*Description:* This sequence diagram illustrates the workflow for processing a task. The client sends a request, which is routed to the EKS master. The master enqueues the task in SQS. An EKS worker consumes the task, reads input data from FSx for Lustre, writes output data to FSx for Lustre, and sends a completion notification to SQS. The master receives the notification and sends a response back to the client.

```

*Description:* This deployment diagram shows how the components are deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. The EKS node groups, FSx for Lustre file systems, and SQS queues are deployed in each AZ. The Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes traffic across the EKS node groups in different AZs.  FSx can be configured to replicate data between AZs.  SQS is a regional service and is inherently highly available.
