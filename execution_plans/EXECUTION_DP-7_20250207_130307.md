        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

Total Technical Domains: 5
Total Core Requirements: 4
Total Dependencies: 2
Total Challenges: 3
Research Findings: OAuth 2.0 and Active Directory integration is a common requirement for enterprise applications. Best practices emphasize security, including HTTPS, token management, and PKCE. Python libraries like OIDC and python-ldap are commonly used for implementation. Case studies highlight successful integrations in various domains.
</summary>

<analysis>
Main Objective: Implement secure authentication for the Python application using OAuth 2.0, leveraging existing user identities in the enterprise Active Directory and the PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server.

Stakeholders:

* End Users (Human to Machine)
* System Administrators
* Application Developers
* Security Team

Core Requirements:

1.  **OAuth 2.0 Authentication:** The application must support OAuth 2.0 for both machine-to-machine (M2M) and human-to-machine (H2M) interactions.
2.  **Active Directory Integration:** Leverage existing user identities in Active Directory to streamline the authentication process for human users.
3.  **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Support:** Utilize OIDC for user identity verification and attribute retrieval from Active Directory.
4.  **PingFederate Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server for token issuance and management.

Technical Domains:

1.  **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **OAuth 2.0:** Implement the Authorization Code Grant flow with PKCE for secure token exchange.
    *   **OpenID Connect (OIDC):** Utilize OIDC for user authentication and attribute retrieval from Active Directory.
    *   **Python Libraries:** Leverage libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-python` for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC integration.

2.  **Active Directory Integration:**
    *   **LDAP:** Use the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to query Active Directory for user details.
    *   **Python Libraries:** Utilize the `python-ldap` library to interact with Active Directory via LDAP.

3.  **PingFederate Integration:**
    *   **OAuth 2.0 Endpoints:** Configure the application to interact with PingFederate's authorization and token endpoints.
    *   **PingFederate Configuration:** Set up the application as a client in PingFederate and configure access policies.

4.  **Security:**
    *   **HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all communication to protect sensitive data.
    *   **Token Management:** Securely store and manage access tokens and refresh tokens.
    *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS).

5.  **Python Development:**
    *   **Framework:** Utilize a suitable Python web framework (e.g., Flask, Django) to handle routing and requests.
    *   **Libraries:** Leverage existing Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OIDC, LDAP, and secure communication.

Dependencies:

1.  **PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server:** The project relies on the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 token issuance and management.
2.  **Enterprise Active Directory:** User authentication and identity information are sourced from the enterprise Active Directory.

Challenges:

1.  **Active Directory Integration Complexity:** Integrating with Active Directory can be complex, especially considering potential network configurations and security policies.
2.  **PingFederate Configuration:** Properly configuring PingFederate to recognize the application as a trusted client and defining appropriate access policies is crucial.
3.  **Security Considerations:** Ensuring the security of the authentication flow, including secure token storage, handling token expiration, and protecting against potential attacks, is paramount.

Industry Context:

*   **OAuth 2.0:** Widely adopted industry standard for delegated authorization and authentication.
*   **OpenID Connect (OIDC):**  A standard built on top of OAuth 2.0, specifically designed for authentication and providing a standardized way to obtain user information.
*   **Active Directory:** A common directory service used by enterprises for managing users and resources.
*   **PingFederate:** A widely used enterprise federation server that provides identity management and access control services, including OAuth 2.0 support.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Adhering to industry best practices for secure coding, token management, and communication security is crucial.
