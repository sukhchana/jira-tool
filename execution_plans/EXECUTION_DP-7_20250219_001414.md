        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

      "pain_points": "- Decentralized Identity Management: Currently, user authentication and authorization might be handled within the application itself or spread across multiple systems. This leads to increased complexity, security risks, and a poor user experience. - Difficult User Management: Onboarding new users, managing their roles and permissions, and handling offboarding processes can be time-consuming and error-prone without a central system. - Increased Development Effort: Implementing and maintaining authentication and authorization logic within the application diverts resources from core development tasks. - Security Concerns: Decentralized or custom-built solutions might not adhere to the latest security standards, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.",
      "success_metrics": "- Time to Integrate: Measure the time taken to successfully integrate PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider. - User Authentication Success Rate: Track the percentage of successful user login attempts via PingFederate. - Authorization Error Rate: Monitor the number of authorization errors encountered by users after implementation. - Development Effort Reduction: Quantify the time saved in development and maintenance efforts related to authentication and authorization after implementing PingFederate. - User Management Efficiency: Measure the time taken to onboard new users, manage roles and permissions, and offboard users after implementing PingFederate.",
      "similar_implementations": "- Auth0: A popular cloud-based identity platform offering similar OAuth 2.0 and OIDC capabilities. - Okta: Another widely used identity management solution providing centralized authentication and authorization services. - Keycloak: An open-source identity and access management solution that can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. - Azure Active Directory: Microsoft's cloud-based identity platform with robust OAuth 2.0 and OIDC support.",
      "modern_approaches": "- Zero Trust Security: Implement a Zero Trust security model where every access request is verified, regardless of its origin. PingFederate can play a crucial role in enforcing this model. - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable MFA through PingFederate to add an extra layer of security and protect against unauthorized access. - Single Sign-On (SSO): Leverage PingFederate's SSO capabilities to provide users with seamless access to multiple applications with a single set of credentials. - Centralized User Management: Utilize PingFederate's user management features to streamline user provisioning, role assignments, and access control. - API Security: Secure APIs using OAuth 2.0 tokens issued by PingFederate, ensuring that only authorized clients and users can access sensitive data."
