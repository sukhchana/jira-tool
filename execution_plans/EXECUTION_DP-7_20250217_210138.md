        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

<analysis>
<main_objective>
Enable secure authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions using OAuth 2.0, leveraging the existing enterprise Active Directory and PingFederate as the OAuth 2.0 server.
</main_objective>

<stakeholders>
- **Application Users:** Both human and machine users requiring access to the application.
- **System Administrators:** Responsible for managing user access and application security.
</stakeholders>

<core_requirements>
- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) in the Python application.
- **Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the Active Directory, leveraging PingFederate as the identity provider.
- **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement a mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID, roles).
</core_requirements>

<technical_domains>
- **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Best Practices: Implement secure OAuth 2.0 flows, validate tokens, and enforce authorization based on user roles.
    - Technologies: Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `oauthlib` can be used.
- **Identity Management:**
    - Best Practices: Utilize OpenID Connect for user authentication and attribute retrieval.
    - Technologies: Libraries like `openid-connect-python` can be used to interact with PingFederate.
- **Active Directory Integration:**
    - Best Practices: Use secure communication protocols (e.g., LDAPS) for interacting with Active Directory.
    - Technologies: Python libraries like `ldap3` can be used for LDAP communication.
</technical_domains>

<dependencies>
- **PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server:** The application depends on the availability and functionality of the PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect services.
- **Enterprise Active Directory:** User authentication and attribute retrieval rely on the availability and proper configuration of the Active Directory.
</dependencies>

<challenges>
- **Integration Complexity:** Integrating with existing infrastructure (PingFederate, Active Directory) can be complex, requiring careful configuration and testing.
- **Security Considerations:** Implementing secure OAuth 2.0 flows and protecting sensitive information (tokens, user data) is crucial to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Attribute Mapping and User Provisioning:** Defining and implementing a consistent and accurate mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information can be challenging.
</challenges>

<industry_context>
- **Industry Standards:** OAuth 2.0 (RFC 6749), OpenID Connect (OIDC), and LDAP are widely adopted industry standards for authentication and identity management.
- **Best Practices:** Follow security best practices for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect implementations, including secure token handling and validation.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Depending on the industry and data sensitivity, compliance requirements like GDPR or HIPAA might apply, influencing data handling and user privacy considerations.

        <architecture>The application will retrieve user attributes from Active Directory during authentication. A mapping configuration will define how these attributes correspond to application-specific roles and permissions. This mapping will be used to determine the user's access level within the application.</architecture>
        <apis>No new APIs required. Leverages existing Active Directory integration for attribute retrieval.</apis>
        <database>No database changes required for this task. Future tasks may involve storing user roles and permissions locally.</database>
        <security>
            - Ensure that the mapping configuration is stored securely and not accessible to unauthorized users.
            - Implement strict validation of user attributes retrieved from Active Directory to prevent privilege escalation.
