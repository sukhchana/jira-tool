        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

    <research_findings>
        - Python offers robust libraries like Flask-OAuthlib and oauthlib for OAuth 2 implementation.
        - OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a common choice for user authentication with OAuth 2, providing standardized user information retrieval.
        - PingFederate offers comprehensive documentation and SDKs for integration.
        - Security considerations like token handling, storage, and validation are crucial.

<analysis>
    <main_objective>
        Enable secure authentication for the Python application using OAuth 2, leveraging the existing enterprise Active Directory and PingFederate as the OAuth 2 server. This should support both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication scenarios.
    </main_objective>

    <stakeholders>
        - **Application Users:** Both human and machine users requiring access to the application.
        - **System Administrators:** Responsible for managing the application and its integration with Active Directory and PingFederate.
    </stakeholders>

    <core_requirements>
        - **OAuth 2 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2 authorization flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) using a suitable Python library.
        - **Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the enterprise Active Directory, retrieving necessary user information for authorization.
        - **PingFederate Integration:**  Configure PingFederate as the OAuth 2 authorization server and establish secure communication channels for token exchange and validation.
    </core_requirements>

    <technical_domains>
        - **OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect:**  Understanding OAuth 2 flows, grant types, token management, and OpenID Connect for user information retrieval is crucial. Libraries like Flask-OAuthlib and oauthlib can simplify implementation.
        - **Active Directory and LDAP:** Knowledge of Active Directory structure, user attributes, and potentially LDAP for querying user information is necessary for integration.
        - **PingFederate API and SDK:**  Familiarity with PingFederate's API documentation, SDKs (potentially Python SDK), and configuration options is essential for seamless integration.
    </technical_domains>

    <dependencies>
        - **Enterprise Active Directory:**  The application relies on the existing Active Directory for user authentication and information.
        - **PingFederate OAuth 2 Server:**  The project depends on the availability and proper configuration of PingFederate as the OAuth 2 authorization server.
    </dependencies>

    <challenges>
        - **Token Management:** Securely storing, validating, and refreshing OAuth 2 tokens is critical for maintaining application security.
        - **PingFederate Integration Complexity:**  Integrating with PingFederate might involve navigating complex configuration settings and potential compatibility issues.
        - **User Attribute Mapping:**  Mapping user attributes from Active Directory to application-specific roles and permissions requires careful planning and implementation.
    </challenges>

    <industry_context>
        - **OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect are industry-standard protocols for secure authentication and authorization.**
        - **Best practices emphasize secure token handling, strong encryption, and adherence to the principle of least privilege.**
        - **Compliance requirements like GDPR and CCPA might dictate how user data is handled and protected during authentication and authorization.**

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for the Python application using OAuth 2, leveraging the existing enterprise Active Directory and PingFederate as the OAuth 2 server. This should support both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication scenarios.
Technical Domains:
- OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect:**  Understanding OAuth 2 flows, grant types, token management, and OpenID Connect for user information retrieval is crucial. Libraries like Flask-OAuthlib and oauthlib can simplify implementation.

- PingFederate API and SDK:**  Familiarity with PingFederate's API documentation, SDKs (potentially Python SDK), and configuration options is essential for seamless integration.
Core Requirements:
- OAuth 2 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2 authorization flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) using a suitable Python library.
- Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the enterprise Active Directory, retrieving necessary user information for authorization.
