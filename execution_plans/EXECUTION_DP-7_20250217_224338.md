        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

## User Story Generation - User Story - Machine-to-Machine Communication

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for both human and machine users by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-based Enterprise Active Directory.
Stakeholders: - Application Users:** Both human and machine users requiring access to the application.
- System Administrators:** Responsible for managing user access and system security.
Core Requirements: - OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens.
- Active Directory Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the Enterprise Active Directory via PingFederate.
- User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement a mapping between Active Directory user attributes and application-specific user roles and permissions.
Technical Domains: - Authentication and Authorization:**
- Best Practices:** Implement secure token handling, enforce token expiration and refresh mechanisms, and adhere to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications.
- Technologies:** Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-client` can be used.
- Active Directory and LDAP:**
- Best Practices:** Utilize secure communication channels (LDAPS), implement appropriate error handling for connection issues, and optimize queries for performance.
- Technologies:** Python libraries like `ldap3` can be used to interact with Active Directory.
- Python Web Framework Integration:**
- Best Practices:** Choose a suitable framework (e.g., Flask, Django) based on project requirements and leverage existing security middleware and extensions.
- Technologies:** Flask-OAuthlib or Django OAuth Toolkit can simplify integration with OAuth 2.0 providers.
Dependencies: - PingFederate Server:** The project relies on the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect functionality.
- Active Directory Schema:**  Understanding the Active Directory schema is crucial for mapping user attributes correctly.
Challenges: - PingFederate Integration:** Configuring PingFederate for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect with the correct settings for the Python application might require specific expertise.
- Secure Token Management:** Implementing secure storage and handling of access tokens and refresh tokens is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.
- Error Handling and Logging:** Robust error handling and logging are essential for troubleshooting authentication issues and ensuring system security.

## User Story Generation - User Story - Role-Based Access Control

### Prompt
```

        Please create 3-5 user stories based on this epic analysis. For each story, focus on clear user value and technical feasibility.

        IMPORTANT: You MUST return a JSON array of user stories following EXACTLY the structure specified below.

        Epic Analysis:
        Main Objective: Enable secure authentication for both human and machine users by implementing OAuth 2.0 and integrating with the existing PingFederate-based Enterprise Active Directory.
Stakeholders: - Application Users:** Both human and machine users requiring access to the application.
- System Administrators:** Responsible for managing user access and system security.
Core Requirements: - OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens.
- Active Directory Integration:** Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the Enterprise Active Directory via PingFederate.
- User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement a mapping between Active Directory user attributes and application-specific user roles and permissions.
Technical Domains: - Authentication and Authorization:**
- Best Practices:** Implement secure token handling, enforce token expiration and refresh mechanisms, and adhere to OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications.
- Technologies:** Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-client` can be used.
- Active Directory and LDAP:**
- Best Practices:** Utilize secure communication channels (LDAPS), implement appropriate error handling for connection issues, and optimize queries for performance.
- Technologies:** Python libraries like `ldap3` can be used to interact with Active Directory.
- Python Web Framework Integration:**
- Best Practices:** Choose a suitable framework (e.g., Flask, Django) based on project requirements and leverage existing security middleware and extensions.
- Technologies:** Flask-OAuthlib or Django OAuth Toolkit can simplify integration with OAuth 2.0 providers.
Dependencies: - PingFederate Server:** The project relies on the existing PingFederate server for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect functionality.
- Active Directory Schema:**  Understanding the Active Directory schema is crucial for mapping user attributes correctly.
Challenges: - PingFederate Integration:** Configuring PingFederate for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect with the correct settings for the Python application might require specific expertise.
- Secure Token Management:** Implementing secure storage and handling of access tokens and refresh tokens is crucial to prevent unauthorized access.
- Error Handling and Logging:** Robust error handling and logging are essential for troubleshooting authentication issues and ensuring system security.
