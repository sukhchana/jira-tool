        1. Start each task with <technical_task> on its own line
        2. End each task with </technical_task> on its own line
        3. Each field inside must:
           - Start with double asterisks and end with colon (e.g., **Task:**)
           - Be on its own line
           - Have a space after the colon
        4. Fields must appear in this exact order:
           - Task
           - Description
           - Technical Domain
           - Complexity
           - Dependencies
           - Implementation Notes
           - Modern Practices
           - Security Considerations
        5. NO blank lines between fields within a task
        6. ONE blank line between different tasks
        7. NO other text or formatting outside the XML tags

        Requirements:
        - Each user story should have 1-2 technical tasks
        - Tasks should be specific and implementable
        - No task should take more than 3 days
        - Include both frontend and backend work where relevant
        - Consider infrastructure and testing needs
        - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
        - Incorporate modern best practices found through research
        - Consider security implications for each task

        IMPORTANT: Your response must be parseable XML. Each technical task must be a complete XML element with proper opening and closing tags.
