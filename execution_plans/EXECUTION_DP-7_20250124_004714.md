        Please analyze this epic and provide a structured breakdown of its scope.

        Epic Summary: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory
        
        Epic Description:
        Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

Add the ability to support OAUTH 2 authentication, where machine to machine and human to machine capabilities are supported. 

The human to machine population will already have identities in Active Directory. 

Ensure there is a way to source their details, using perhaps OpenID Connect, specify what fields people should be using for certain things, i.e. what field contains a users user-id etcâ€¦

Remember the project is written in Python, so specify a plan of action to support this. 

Remember also that the enterprise OAUTH 2 server exists and is implemented by PING Federate

## Epic Analysis: Add Authentication with OAUTH 2 and Integrate with Enterprise Active Directory

<summary>
Total Technical Domains: **4**
Total Core Requirements: **5**
Total Dependencies: **2**
Total Challenges: **3**
</summary>

<analysis>

**Main Objective:** 
Enable secure authentication and authorization for the Python application by implementing OAuth 2.0, integrating with the existing enterprise Active Directory (AD) using OpenID Connect (OIDC), and leveraging the existing PingFederate OAuth 2.0 server.

**Stakeholders:**

* **End Users:**  Those who will authenticate with the application.
* **System Administrators:** Responsible for managing user accounts and access.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the authentication solution.
* **Security Team:** Responsible for ensuring the security of the authentication solution.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to secure the application.
2. **Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the existing Active Directory to leverage existing user identities.
3. **OpenID Connect (OIDC) Utilization:** Utilize OIDC for user authentication and attribute retrieval from Active Directory.
4. **User Attribute Mapping:** Define and implement mapping between Active Directory attributes and application-specific user information (e.g., user ID).
5. **PingFederate Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate server as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC provider.

**Technical Domains:**

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC)
2. **Directory Services:** Active Directory, LDAP
3. **Python Development:**  Libraries for OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and Active Directory interaction
4. **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** PingFederate configuration and integration

**Dependencies:**

1. **Existing Active Directory:**  The solution relies on a functional and accessible Active Directory.
2. **PingFederate OAuth 2.0 Server:** The solution depends on the availability and proper configuration of the PingFederate server.

**Challenges:**

1. **Python Library Selection:** Identifying and integrating suitable Python libraries for OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and Active Directory interaction.
2. **PingFederate Integration Complexity:**  Configuring PingFederate for OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and Active Directory integration can be complex.
3. **User Attribute Mapping:**  Ensuring accurate and consistent mapping of user attributes between Active Directory and the application.
