{
  "main_objective": "Enable secure authentication for the Python application using OAuth 2, leveraging the existing enterprise Active Directory and PingFederate as the OAuth 2 server. This should support both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine authentication scenarios.",
  "technical_domains": [
    "OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect:**  Understanding OAuth 2 flows, grant types, token management, and OpenID Connect for user information retrieval is crucial. Libraries like Flask-OAuthlib and oauthlib can simplify implementation.",
    "Active Directory and LDAP:** Knowledge of Active Directory structure, user attributes, and potentially LDAP for querying user information is necessary for integration.",
    "PingFederate API and SDK:**  Familiarity with PingFederate's API documentation, SDKs (potentially Python SDK), and configuration options is essential for seamless integration."
  ],
  "core_requirements": [
    "OAuth 2 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2 authorization flows (likely Authorization Code Grant for human users and Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) using a suitable Python library.",
    "Active Directory Integration:**  Utilize OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate users against the enterprise Active Directory, retrieving necessary user information for authorization.",
    "PingFederate Integration:**  Configure PingFederate as the OAuth 2 authorization server and establish secure communication channels for token exchange and validation."
  ],
  "stakeholders": [
    "Application Users:** Both human and machine users requiring access to the application.",
    "System Administrators:** Responsible for managing the application and its integration with Active Directory and PingFederate."
