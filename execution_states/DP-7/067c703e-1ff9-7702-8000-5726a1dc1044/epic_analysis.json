  "main_objective": "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for both machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions, integrating with the existing Enterprise Active Directory via OpenID Connect and utilizing Ping Federate as the OAuth 2.0 server, all within a Python-based project.",
  "technical_domains": [
    "OAuth 2.0 Implementation (Best Practices: Use a well-vetted library like `Authlib` or `OAuthLib` for Python.  Implement proper token validation and revocation.  Follow the principle of least privilege when requesting scopes.)**",
    "OpenID Connect Integration (Best Practices:  Use a library like `Flask-OIDC` or `python-oidc-client`.  Securely store and manage client secrets.  Validate the ID token signature and claims.)**",
    "Active Directory Integration (Best Practices: Use secure LDAP or ADAL/MSAL libraries for Python.  Implement proper error handling for AD connectivity issues.  Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing AD data.)**",
    "Ping Federate Configuration (Best Practices:  Work closely with the IT Operations team to configure Ping Federate correctly.  Ensure proper client registration and scope definitions.  Monitor Ping Federate logs for errors and security events.)**"
