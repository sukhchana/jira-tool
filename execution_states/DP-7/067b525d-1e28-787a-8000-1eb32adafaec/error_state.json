    "technical_domains": [
      "OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:** Utilize Python libraries like `requests-oauthlib` and `openid-connect-python` for implementing OAuth 2.0 flows and interacting with OpenID Connect providers.",
      "PingFederate Integration:** Leverage PingFederate's API and SDKs (potentially Python-based) to communicate with the existing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect endpoints for authentication and user data retrieval.",
      "Data Security and Privacy:** Implement robust security measures to protect user data throughout the authentication process, including secure storage of tokens and adherence to data minimization principles."
    ],
    "core_requirements": [
      "OAuth 2.0 Implementation:** Implement OAuth 2.0 flows (Authorization Code Grant for human users, Client Credentials Grant for machine-to-machine) to obtain access tokens for authorized access.",
      "Active Directory Integration:** Integrate with the existing PingFederate server to leverage existing user identities and authentication mechanisms.",
      "User Data Management:** Define a clear strategy for sourcing user details from Active Directory (potentially using OpenID Connect) and mapping relevant attributes like user ID."
    ],
    "stakeholders": [
      "Application Users:** Both human and machine users who need to authenticate to access the application.",
      "System Administrators:** Responsible for managing and maintaining the authentication system and its integration with Active Directory."
