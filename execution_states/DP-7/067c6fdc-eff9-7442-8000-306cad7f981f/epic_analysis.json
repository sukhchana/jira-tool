  "main_objective": "Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and integrate with Enterprise Active Directory via Ping Federate to enable secure machine-to-machine and human-to-machine access for a Python-based application.",
  "technical_domains": [
    "OAuth 2.0 Implementation (Best Practices: RFC 6749, OWASP guidelines):**  Choosing the appropriate grant types (authorization code, client credentials, etc.), handling token storage securely (using encryption and appropriate storage mechanisms), implementing token refresh mechanisms, and validating tokens.  Python libraries like `Authlib` and `oauthlib` are well-suited.  Consider using a framework like Flask or Django for easier integration.",
    "OpenID Connect (Best Practices: OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification):**  Leveraging OpenID Connect on top of OAuth 2.0 to obtain user profile information from Ping Federate after successful authentication.  This simplifies user attribute retrieval.  Libraries like `Authlib` support OpenID Connect.",
    "Active Directory Integration (Best Practices: LDAP best practices, Microsoft Graph API documentation):**  Determining the best method for accessing Active Directory data (LDAP or Microsoft Graph API).  LDAP requires careful configuration and security considerations.  Microsoft Graph API offers a more modern and often simpler approach, but requires appropriate permissions and Azure AD configuration.  Python libraries like `ldap3` can be used for LDAP integration.",
    "Ping Federate Integration (Best Practices: Ping Federate documentation, vendor-provided SDKs):**  Understanding Ping Federate's configuration, capabilities, and integration options.  Leveraging any provided SDKs or APIs to simplify the integration process.  Properly configuring Ping Federate to trust the application and issue tokens with the necessary claims."
