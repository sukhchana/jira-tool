  user_experience:
    pain_points: Remembering separate credentials for different applications.
    success_metrics: Increased login success rate, reduced support requests for password
      resets.
    similar_implementations: Many enterprise applications use ADFS (Active Directory
      Federation Services) for similar single sign-on experiences.

      text: The user clicks the "Login with AD" button.
    - keyword: Then
      text: The user is redirected to the AD login page.
    - keyword: And
      text: After successful AD authentication, the user is redirected back to the
        application and logged in.

    name: Invalid AD Credentials
    steps:
    - keyword: Given
      text: A user is on the AD login page.
    - keyword: When
      text: The user enters incorrect AD credentials.
    - keyword: Then
      text: An error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to re-enter their
        credentials.

    success_metrics: No unauthorized access to sensitive data, successful security
      audits.
    similar_implementations: Many API platforms and service providers use client credentials
      grant for machine-to-machine authentication.
  scenarios:
  - id: SCENARIO-4
    name: Successful Machine-to-Machine Communication
    steps:
    - keyword: Given
      text: Application A needs to access data from Application B.
    - keyword: When
      text: Application A sends an API request to Application B with a valid access
        token.
    - keyword: Then
      text: Application B validates the token and grants access to the requested data.
  - id: SCENARIO-5
    name: Invalid Access Token
    steps:
    - keyword: Given
      text: Application A sends an API request with an invalid or expired access token.
    - keyword: When

  title: User Story - View and Manage User Roles and Permissions
  description: As a system administrator, I want to view and manage user roles and
    permissions based on their Active Directory groups so that I can control access
    to sensitive application features.

      application access control.
    success_metrics: Reduced administrative overhead, improved security by enforcing
      least privilege, fewer access-related issues.
    similar_implementations: Many identity and access management (IAM) solutions offer
      similar features for role-based access control and integration with directory
      services.
