    title: Establish OpenID Connect Integration with Active Directory
    description: Configure PING Federate to leverage OpenID Connect for authenticating
      human users against the Enterprise Active Directory. This involves setting up
      an OpenID Connect provider in PING Federate and connecting it to Active Directory
      using appropriate protocols (e.g., LDAP, LDAPS).
    acceptance_criteria: <criterion>PING Federate is successfully integrated with
      Active Directory as an OpenID Connect provider.</criterion> <criterion>Users
      can authenticate using their Active Directory credentials via OpenID Connect.</criterion>
      <criterion>Active Directory attributes are correctly mapped to OpenID Connect
      claims.</criterion>
